    <h2><a name="millerism"
       id="millerism"><i>MILLERISM.</i></a></h2>

    <p>Toward the close of the last century there was born in New
    England one William Miller, whose life, until he was past
    fifty, was the life of the average American of his time. He
    drank, we suppose, his share of New England rum, when a young
    man; married a comely Yankee girl, and reared a family of
    chubby-cheeked children; went about his business, whatever it
    was, on week days, and when Sunday came, went to meeting with
    commendable regularity. He certainly read the Old Testament,
    especially the Book of Daniel, and of the New Testament at
    least the Book of Revelation. Like many a wiser man before him,
    he was troubled at what he read, filled as it was with mystical
    numbers and strange beasts, and he sought to understand it, and
    to apply it to the days in which he lived. He made the
    discovery that the world was to be destroyed in 1843, and went
    to and fro in the land preaching that comfortable doctrine. He
    had many followers&mdash;as many as fifty thousand, it is said,
    who thought they were prepared for the end of all things; some
    going so far as to lay in a large stock of ascension robes.
    Though no writer himself, he was the cause of a great deal of
    writing on the part of others, who flooded the land with a
    special and curious literature&mdash;the literature of
    Millerism. It is not of that, however, that we would speak
    now.</p>

    <p>But before this Miller arose&mdash;we proceed to say, if
    only to show that we are familiar with other members of the
    family&mdash;there was another, and very different Miller, who
    was born in old England, about one hundred years earlier than
    our sadly, or gladly, mistaken Second Adventist. His Christian
    name was Joseph, and he was an actor of repute, celebrated for
    his excellence in some of the comedies of Congreve. The
    characters which he played may have been comic ones, but he was
    a serious man. Indeed, his gravity was so well known in his
    lifetime that it was reckoned the height of wit, when he was
    dead, to father off upon him a Jest Book! This joke, bad as it
    was, was better than any joke in the book. It made him famous,
    so famous that for the next hundred years every little <i>bon
    mot</i> was laid at his door, metaphorically speaking, the
    puniest youngest brat of them being christened "Old Joe."</p>

    <p>After Joseph Miller had become what Mercutio calls "a grave
    man," his descendants went into literature largely, as any one
    may see by turning to Allibone's very voluminous dictionary,
    where upwards of seventy of the name are immortalized, the most
    noted of whom are Thomas Miller, basket-maker and poet, and
    Hugh Miller, the learned stone-mason of Cromarty, whose many
    works, we confess with much humility, we have not read. To the
    sixty-eight Millers in Allibone (if that be the exact number),
    must now be added another&mdash;Mr. Joaquin Miller, who
    published, two or three months since, a collection of poems
    entitled "Songs of the Sierras." From which one of the Millers
    mentioned above his ancestry is derived, we are not informed;
    but, it would seem, from the one first-named. For clearly the
    end of all things literary cannot be far off, if Mr. Miller is
    the "coming poet," for whom so many good people have been
    looking all their lives. We are inclined to think that such is
    not the fact. We think, on the whole, that it is to the other
    Miller&mdash;Joking Miller&mdash;his genealogy is to be
    traced.</p>

    <p>But who is Mr. Miller, and what has he done? A good many
    besides ourselves put that question, less than a year ago, and
    nobody could answer it. Nobody, that is, in America. In England
    he was a great man. He went over to England, unheralded, it is
    stated, and was soon discovered to be a poet. Swinburne took
    him up; the Rossettis took him up; the critics took him up; he
    was taken up by everybody in England, except the police, who,
    as a rule, fight shy of poets. He went to fashionable parties
    in a red shirt, with trowsers tucked into his boots, and
    instead of being shown to the door by the powdered footman, was
    received with enthusiasm. It is incredible, but it is true. A
    different state of society existed, thirty or forty years ago,
    when another American poet went to England; and we advise our
    readers, who have leisure at their command, to compare it with
    the present social lawlessness of the upper classes among the
    English. To do this, they have only to turn to the late N.P.
    Willis's "Pencilings by the Way," and contrast his descriptions
    of the fashionable life of London then, with almost any
    journalistic account of the same kind of life now. The contrast
    will be all the more striking if they will only hunt up the
    portraits of Disraeli, with his long, dark locks flowing on his
    shoulders, and the portrait of Bulwer, behind his "stunning"
    waistcoat, and his cascade of neck-cloth, and then imagine Mr.
    Miller standing beside them, in his red shirt and high-topped
    California boots! Like Byron, Mr. Miller "woke up one morning
    and found himself famous."</p>

    <p>We compare the sudden famousness of Mr. Miller with the
    sudden famousness of Byron, because the English critics have
    done so; and because they are pleased to consider Mr. Miller as
    Byron's successor! Byron, we are told, was the only poet whom
    he had read, before he went to England; and is the only poet to
    whom he bears a resemblance. How any of these critics could
    have arrived at this conclusion, with the many glaring
    imitations of Swinburne&mdash;at his worst&mdash;staring him in
    the face from Mr. Miller's volume, is inconceivable. But,
    perhaps, they do not read Swinburne. Do they read Byron?</p>

    <p>There are, however, some points of resemblance between Byron
    and Mr. Miller. Byron traveled, when young, in countries not
    much visited by the English; Mr. Miller claims to have
    traveled, when young, in countries not visited by the English
    at all. This was, and is, an advantage to both Byron and Mr.
    Miller. But it was, and is, a serious disadvantage to their
    readers, who cannot well ascertain the truth, or falsehood, of
    the poets they admire. The accuracy of Byron's descriptions of
    foreign lands has long been admitted; the accuracy of Mr.
    Miller's descriptions is not admitted, we believe, by those who
    are familiar with the ground he professes to have gone
    over.</p>

    <p>Another point of resemblance between Byron and Mr. Miller
    is, that the underlying idea of their poetry is autobiographic.
    We do not say that it was really so in Byron's case, although
    he, we know, would have had us believe as much; nor do we say
    that it is really so in Mr. Miller's case, although he, too, we
    suspect, would have us believe as much.</p>

    <p>Mr. Miller resembles Byron as his "Arizonian" resembles
    Byron's "Lara." <i>Lara</i> and <i>Arizonian</i> are birds of
    the same dark feather. They have journeyed in strange lands;
    they have had strange experiences; they have returned to
    Civilization. Each, in his way, is a Blighted Being! "Who is
    she?" we inquire with the wise old Spanish Judge, for,
    certainly, <i>Woman</i> is at the bottom of it all. If our
    readers wish to know <i>what</i> woman, we refer them to
    "Arizonian:" they, of course, have read "Lara."</p>

    <p>Byron was a great poet, but Byronism is dead. Mr. Miller is
    not a great poet, and his spurious Byronism will not live. We
    shall all see the end of Millerism.</p><br />


    <h2><a name="romance"
       id="romance"><i>THE REAL ROMANCE.</i></a></h2>

    <p>The author laid down his pen, and leaned back in his big
    easy chair. The last word had been
    written&mdash;Finis&mdash;and there was the complete book,
    quite a tall pile of manuscript, only waiting for the printer's
    hands to become immortal: so the author whispered to himself.
    He had worked hard upon it; great pains had been expended upon
    the delineations of character, and the tone and play of
    incident; the plot, too, had been worked up with much artistic
    force and skill; and, above all, everything was so strikingly
    original; no one, in regarding the various characters of the
    tale, could say: this is intended for so-and-so! No, nothing
    precisely like the persons in his romance had ever actually
    existed; of that the author was certain, and in that he was
    very probably correct. To be sure, there was the character of
    the country girl, Mary, which he had taken from his own little
    waiting-maid: but that was a very subordinate element, and
    although, on the whole, he rather regretted having introduced
    anything so incongruous and unimaginative, he decided to let it
    go. The romance, as a whole, was too great to be injured by one
    little country girl, drawn from real life. "And by the way,"
    murmured the author to himself, "I wish Mary would bring in my
    tea."</p>

    <p>He settled himself still more comfortably in his easy chair,
    and thought, and looked at his manuscript; and the manuscript
    looked back; but all <i>its</i> thinking had been done for it.
    Neither spoke&mdash;the author, because the book already knew
    all he had to say; and the book, because its time to speak and
    be immortal had not yet arrived. The fire had all the talking
    to itself, and it cackled, and hummed, and skipped about so
    cheerfully that one would have imagined it expected to be the
    very first to receive a presentation copy of the work on the
    table. "How I would devour its contents!" laughed the fire.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the author did not comprehend the full force of the
    fire's remark, but the voice was so cosy and soothing, the fire
    itself so ruddy and genial, and the easy chair so softly
    cushioned and hospitable, that he very soon fell into a
    condition which enabled him to see, hear, and understand a
    great many things which might seem remarkable, and, indeed,
    almost incredible.</p>

    <p>The manuscript on the table which had hitherto remained
    perfectly quiet, now rustled its leaves nervously, and finally
    flung itself wide open. A murmur then arose, as of several
    voices, and presently there appeared (though whether stepping
    from between the leaves of the book itself, or growing together
    from the surrounding atmosphere, the author could not well make
    out) a number of peculiar-looking individuals, at the first
    glance appearing to be human beings, though a clear
    investigation revealed in each some odd lack or exaggeration of
    gesture, feature, or manner, which might create a doubt as to
    whether they actually were, after all, what they purported to
    be, or only some <i>lusus natur&aelig;</i>. But the author was
    not slow to recognize them, more especially as, happening to
    cast a glance at the manuscript, he noticed that it was such no
    longer, but a collection of unwritten sheets of paper, blank as
    when it lay in the drawer at the stationer's&mdash;unwitting of
    the lofty destiny awaiting it.</p>

    <p>Here, then, were the immortal creations which were soon to
    astound the world, come, in person, to pay their respects to
    the author of their being. He arose and made a profound
    obeisance to the august company, which they one and all
    returned, though in such a queer variety of ways, that the
    author, albeit aware that every individual had the best of
    reasons for employing, under certain special circumstances, his
    or her particular manner of salute, could scarcely forbear
    smiling at the effect they all together produced in his own
    unpretending study.</p>

    <p>"Your welcome visit," said the author, addressing his guests
    with all the geniality of which he was master (for they seemed
    somewhat stiff and ill-at-ease), "gives me peculiar
    gratification. I regret not having asked some of my friends,
    the critics, up here to make your acquaintance. I am sure you
    would all come to the best possible understanding
    directly."</p>

    <p>"They cannot fathom <i>me</i>," exclaimed a strikingly
    handsome young man, with pale lofty brow, and dark clustering
    locks, who was leaning with proud grace against the
    mantel-piece. "They may take my life, but they cannot read my
    soul." And he laughed, scornfully, as he always did.</p>

    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>

    <p>This was a passage from that famous ante-mortem soliloquy in
    which the hero of the romance indulges in the last chapter but
    one. The author, while, of course, he could not deny that the
    elegance of the diction was only equaled by the originality of
    the sentiment, yet felt a slight uneasiness that his hero
    should adopt so defiant a tone with those who were indeed to be
    the arbiters of his existence.</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid there's not enough perception of the <i>comme il
    faut</i> in him to suit the every-day world," muttered he. "To
    be sure, he was not constructed for ordinary ends. Do you find
    yourself at home in this life, madame?" he continued aloud,
    turning to a young lady of matchless beauty, whose brief career
    of passionate love and romantic misery the author had described
    in thrilling chapters. She raised her luminous eyes to his, and
    murmured reproachfully: "Why speak to me of Life? if it be not
    Love, it is Life no longer!"</p>

    <p>It was very beautiful, and the author recollected having
    thought, at the time he wrote it down, that it was about the
    most forcible sentence in that most powerful passage of his
    book. But it was rather an exaggerated tone to adopt in the
    face of such common-place surroundings. Had this exquisite
    creature, after all, no better sense of the appropriate?</p>

    <p>"No one can know better than I, my dear Constance," said the
    author, in a fatherly tone, "what a beautiful, tender, and
    lofty soul yours is; but would it not be well, once in a while,
    to veil its lustre&mdash;to subdue it to a tint more in keeping
    with the unvariegated hue of common circumstance?"</p>

    <p>"Heartless and cruel!" sobbed Constance, falling upon the
    sofa, "hast thou not made me what I am?"</p>

    <p>This accusation, intended by the author to be leveled at the
    traitor lover, quite took him aback when directed, with so much
    aptness, too, at his respectable self. But whom but himself
    could he blame, if, when common sense demanded only civility
    and complaisance, she persisted in adhering to the tragic and
    sentimental? He was provoked that he had not noticed this
    defect in time to remedy it; yet he had once considered
    Constance as, perhaps, the completest triumph of his genius!
    There seemed to be something particularly disenchanting in the
    atmosphere of that study.</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid you're a failure, ma'am, after all," sighed the
    author, eyeing her disconsolately. "You're so one-sided!"</p>

    <p>At this heartless observation the lady gave a harrowing
    shriek, thereby summoning to her side a broad-shouldered young
    fellow, clad in soldier's garb, with a countenance betokening
    much boldness and determination. He faced the author with an
    angry frown, which the latter at once recognized as being that
    of Constance's brother Sam.</p>

    <p>"Now then, old bloke!" sang out that young gentleman, "what
    new deviltry are you up to? Down on your knees and beg her
    pardon, or, by George! I'll run you through the body!"</p>

    <p>On this character the author had expended much thought and
    care. He was the type of the hardy and bold adventurer, rough
    and unpolished, perhaps, but of true and sterling metal, who,
    by dint of his vigorous common sense and honest, energetic
    nature, should at once clear and lighten whatever in the
    atmosphere of the story was obscure and sombre; and, by the
    salutary contrast of his fresh and rugged character with the
    delicate or morbid traits of his fellow beings, lend a graceful
    symmetry to the whole. The sentence Sam had just delivered with
    so much emphasis ought to have been addressed to the traitor
    lover, when discovered in the act of inconstancy, and, so
    given, would have been effective and dramatic. But at a
    juncture like the present, the author felt it to be simply
    ludicrous, and had he not been so mortified, would have laughed
    outright!</p>

    <p>"Don't make a fool of yourself, Sam," remonstrated he.
    "Reflect whom you're addressing, and in what company you are,
    and do try and talk like a civilized being."</p>

    <p>"Come, come! no palaver," returned Sam, in a loud and
    boisterous tone (to do him justice, he had never been taught
    any other); "down on your marrow-bones at once, or here goes
    for your gizzard!" and he drew his sword with a flourish.</p>

    <p>So this was the rough diamond&mdash;the epitome of common
    sense! Why, he was a half-witted, impertinent, overbearing
    booby, and his author longed to get him across his knee, and
    correct him in the good old way. But meantime the point of the
    young warrior's sword was getting unpleasantly near the left
    breast-pocket of the author's dressing gown (which he wore at
    the time), and the latter happened to recollect, with a nervous
    thrill, that this was the sword which mortally wounded the
    traitor lover (for whom Sam evidently mistook him) during the
    stirring combat so vividly described in the twenty-second
    chapter. Could he but have foreseen the future, what a
    different ending that engagement should have had! But again it
    was too late, and the author sprang behind the big easy chair
    with astonishing agility, and from that vantage ground
    endeavored to bring on a parley.</p>

    <p>Yet how could he argue and expostulate against himself? How
    arraign Sam of harboring murderous designs which he had himself
    implanted in his bosom? How, indeed, expect him to comprehend
    conversation so entirely foreign to his experience? It was an
    awkward dilemma.</p>

    <p>It was Sam who took it by the horns. Somebody, he felt, must
    be mortally wounded; and finding himself defrauded of one
    subject, he took up with the next he encountered, which chanced
    to be none other than the venerable and white-haired gentleman
    who filled the position, in the tale, of a wealthy and
    benevolent uncle. The author, having always felt a sentiment of
    exceptional respect and admiration for this reverend and
    patriarchal personage, who by his gentle words and sage
    counsels, no less than his noble generosity, had done so much
    to elevate and sweeten the tone of his book, fell into an
    ecstasy of terror at witnessing the approach of his seemingly
    inevitable destruction; especially as he perceived that the
    poor old fellow (who never in his life had met with aught but
    reverence and affection, and knew nothing of the nature of
    deadly weapons and impulses) was, so far, from attempting to
    defend himself, or even escape, actually opening his arms to
    the widest extent of avuncular hospitality, and preparing to
    take his assassin, sword and all, into his fond and forgiving
    heart!</p>

    <p>"You old fool!" shrieked the author, in the excess of his
    irritation and despair; "he isn't your repentant nephew! Why
    can't you keep your forgiveness until it's wanted?"</p>

    <p>But Uncle Dudley having been created solely to forgive and
    benefit, was naturally incapable of taking care of himself, and
    would certainly have been run through the ample white
    waistcoat, had not an unexpected and wholly unprecedented
    interruption averted so awful a catastrophe.</p>

    <p>A small, graceful figure, wearing a picturesque white cap,
    with jaunty ribbons, and a short scarlet petticoat, from
    beneath which peeped the prettiest feet and ancles ever seen,
    stepped suddenly between the philanthropic victim and his
    would-be-murderer, dealt the latter a vigorous blow across the
    face with a broom she carried, thereby toppling him over
    ignominiously into the coal-scuttle, and then, placing her
    plump hands saucily akimbo, she exclaimed with enchanting
    <i>naivete</i>: "There! Mr. Free-and-easy! take <i>that</i> for
    your imperance."</p>

    <p>This little incident caused the author to fall back into his
    easy chair in a condition of profound emotion. It appeared to
    have corrected a certain dimness or obliquity in his vision, of
    the existence of which its cure rendered him for the first time
    conscious. The appearance of the little country girl (whose
    very introduction into the romance the author had looked upon
    with misgivings) had afforded the first gleam of natural,
    refreshing, wholesome interest&mdash;in fact, the only relief
    to all that was vapid, irrational, and unreal&mdash;which the
    combined action of the characters in his romance had succeeded
    in producing. But the enchantress who had effected this, so far
    from being the most unadulterated product of his own brain and
    genius, was the only one of all his <i>dramatis
    person&aelig;</i> who was not in the slightest degree indebted
    to him for her existence. She was nothing more than an accurate
    copy of Mary the house-maid, while the others&mdash;the
    mis-formed, ill-balanced, one-sided creations, who, the moment
    they were placed beyond the pale of their written
    instructions&mdash;put out of the regular and pre-arranged
    order of their going&mdash;displayed in every word and gesture
    their utter lack and want of comprehension of the simplest
    elements of human nature: <i>these</i> were the unaided
    offspring of the author's fancy. And yet it was by help of such
    as these he had thought to push his way to immortality! How the
    world would laugh at him! and, as he thought this, a few bitter
    tears of shame and humiliation trickled down the sides of the
    poor man's nose.</p>

    <p>Presently he looked up. The warlike Sam remained sitting
    disconsolately in the coal-hod; his instructions suggested no
    means of extrication. Forsaken Constance lay fainting on the
    sofa, waiting for some one to chafe her hands and bathe her
    temples. The strikingly handsome betrayer leant in sullen and
    gloomy silence against the mantel-piece, ready to treat all
    advances with stern and defiant obduracy. The benevolent uncle
    stood with open arms and bland smile, never doubting but that
    everybody was preparing for a simultaneous rush to, and
    participation in, his embrace; and, finally, the pretty little
    country girl, with her arms akimbo and her nose in the air,
    remained mistress of the situation. Her unheard of innovation,
    of having done something timely, sensible, and decisive, even
    though not put down in the book, seemed to have paralyzed all
    the others. Ah! she was the only one there who was not less
    than a shadow. The author felt his desolate heart yearn towards
    her, and the next moment found himself on his knees at her
    feet.</p>

    <p>"Mary," cried he, "you are my only reality. The others are
    empty and soulless, but you have a heart. They are the children
    of a conceited brain and visionary experience; you, only, have
    I drawn simply and unaffectedly, as you actually existed.
    Except for you, whom I slighted and despised, my whole romance
    had been an unmitigated falsehood. To you I owe my preservation
    from worse than folly, and my initiation into true wisdom.
    Mary&mdash;dear Mary, in return I have but one thing to offer
    you&mdash;my heart! Can you&mdash;<i>will</i> you not love
    me?"&mdash;</p>

    <p>To his intense surprise, Mary, instead of evincing a
    becoming sense of her romantic situation, burst forth into a
    merry peal of laughter, and, catching him by one shoulder, gave
    him a hearty shake.</p>

    <p>"La sakes! Mr. Author, do wake up! did ever anybody hear
    such a man!"</p>

    <p>There was his room, his fire, his chair, his table, and his
    closely-written manuscript lying quietly upon it. There was he
    himself on his knees on the carpet, and&mdash;there was Mary
    the house-maid, one hand holding the brimming tea-pot, the
    other held by the author against his lips, and laughing and
    blushing in a tumult of surprise, amusement and, perhaps,
    something better than either.</p>

    <p>"Did I say I loved you, Mary?" enquired the author, in a
    state of bewilderment. "Never mind! I say now that I love you
    with all my heart and soul, and ten times as much when awake,
    as when I was dreaming! Will you marry me?"</p>

    <p>Mary only blushed rosier then ever. But she and the author
    always thereafter took their tea cosily together.</p>

    <p>As for the romance, the author took it and threw it into the
    fire, which roared a genial acknowledgment, and in five minutes
    had made itself thoroughly acquainted with every page. There
    remained a bunch of black flakes, and in the center one soft
    glowing spark, which lingered a long while ere finally taking
    its flight up the chimney. It was the description of the little
    country girl.</p>

    <p>"The next book I write shall be all about you," the author
    used to say to his wife, in after years, as they sat together
    before the fire-place, and watched the bright blaze roar up the
    chimney.</p>

    <p>If there be any happier event in the life of a child than
    coming out of school, few children are wise enough to discover
    it. We do not refer to children who go to school
    unwillingly&mdash;thoughtless wights&mdash;whose heads are full
    of play, and whose hands are prone to mischief:&mdash;that
    these should delight in escaping the restraints of the
    school-room, and the eye of its watchful master, is a matter of

    Girl, also, but of that we are not certain; for, not to dwell

    hold that girls are better than boys, as women are better than
    men, and that, consequently, they take more kindly to school
    life. What boys are we know, unless the breed has changed very
    much since we were young, which is now upwards of&mdash;but our
    age does not concern the reader. We did not take kindly to
    school, although we were sadly in need of what we could only
    obtain in school, viz., learning. We went to school with
    reluctance, and remained with discomfort; for we were not as
    robust as the children of our neighbors. We hated school. We
    did not dare to play truant, however, like other boys whom we
    knew (we were not courageous enough for that); so we kept on
    going, fretting, and pining, and&mdash;learning.</p>

    <p>Oh the long days (the hot days of summer, and the cold days
    of winter), when we had to sit for hours on hard wooden
    benches, before uncomfortable desks, bending over grimy slates
    and ink-besprinkled "copy books," and poring over studies in
    which we took no interest&mdash;geography, which we learned by
    rote; arithmetic, which always evaded us, and grammar, which we
    never could master. We could repeat the "rules," but we could
    not "parse;" we could cipher, but our sums would not "prove;"
    we could rattle off the productions of Italy&mdash;"corn, wine,
    silk and oil"&mdash;but we could not "bound" the State in which
    we lived. We were conscious of these defects, and deplored
    them. Our teachers were also conscious of them, and flogged us!
    We had a morbid dread of corporeal punishment, and strove to
    the uttermost to avoid it; but it made no difference, it came
    all the same&mdash;came as surely and swiftly to us as to the
    bad boys who played "hookey," the worse boys who fought, and
    the worst boy who once stoned his master in the street. With
    such a school record as this, is it to be wondered at that we
    rejoiced when school was out? And rejoiced still more when we
    were out of school?</p>

    <p>The feeling which we had then appears to be shared by the
    children in our illustration. Not for the same reasons,
    however; for we question whether the most ignorant of their
    number does not know more of grammar than we do to-day, and is
    not better acquainted with the boundaries of Germany than we
    could ever force ourselves to be. We like these little fellows
    for what they are, and what they will probably be. And we like
    their master, a grave, simple-hearted man, whose proper place
    would appear to be the parish-pulpit. What his scholars learn
    will be worth knowing, if it be not very profound. They will
    learn probity and goodness, and it will not be ferruled into
    them either. Clearly, they do not fear the master, or they
    would not be so unconstrained in his presence. They would not
    make snow balls, as one has done, and another is doing. Soon
    they will begin to pelt each other, and the passers by will not
    mind the snow balls, if they will only remember how they
    themselves felt, and behaved, after coming out of school.</p>

    <p>There is not much in a group of children coming out of
    school. So one might say at first sight, but a little
    reflection will show the fallacy of the remark. One would
    naturally suppose that in every well-regulated State of
    antiquity measures would have been taken to ensure the
    education of all classes of the community, but such was not the
    case. The Spartans under Lycurgus were educated, but their
    education was mainly a physical one, and it did not reach the
    lower orders. The education of Greece generally, even when the
    Greek mind had attained its highest culture, was still largely
    physical&mdash;philosophers, statesmen, and poets priding
    themselves as much upon their athletic feats as upon their
    intellectual endowments. The schools of Rome were private, and
    were confined to the patricians. There was a change for the
    better when Christianity became the established religion.
    Public schools were recommended by a council in the sixth
    century, but rather as a means of teaching the young the
    rudiments of their faith, under the direction of the clergy,
    than as a means of giving them general instruction. It was not
    until the close of the twelfth century that a council ordained
    the establishment of grammar schools in cathedrals for the
    gratuitous instruction of the poor; and not until a century
    later that the ordinance was carried into effect at Lyons.
    Luther found time, amid his multitudinous labors, to interest
    himself in popular education; and, in 1527, he drew up, with
    the aid of Melanchthon, what is known as the Saxon School
    System. The seed was sown, but the Thirty Years' War prevented
    its coming to a speedy maturity. In the middle of the last
    century several of the German States passed laws making it
    compulsory upon parents to send their children to school at a
    certain age; but these laws were not really obeyed until the
    beginning of the present century. German schools are now open
    to the poorest as well as the richest children. The only
    people, except the Germans, who thought of common schools at an
    early period are the Scotch.</p>

    <p>It cost, we see, some centuries of mental blindness to
    discover the need of, and some centuries of struggling to
    establish schools.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"

       id="venice"><i>A GLIMPSE OF VENICE.</i></a></h2>

    <p>The spell which Venice has cast over the English poets is as
    powerful, in its way, as was the influence of Italian
    literature upon the early literature of England. From Chaucer
    down, the poets have turned to Italy for inspiration, and, what
    is still better, have found it. It is not too much to say that
    the "Canterbury Tales" could not have existed, in their present
    form, if Boccaccio had not written the "Decameron;" and it is
    to Boccaccio we are told that the writers of his time were
    indebted for their first knowledge of Homer. Wyatt and Surrey
    transplanted what they could of grace from Petrarch into the
    rough England of Henry the Eighth. We know what the early
    dramatists owe to the Italian storytellers. They went to their
    novels for the plots of their plays, as the novelists of to-day
    go to the criminal calendar for the plots of their stories.
    Shakspeare appears so familiar with Italian life that Mr.
    Charles Armitage Brown, the author of a very curious work on
    Shakspeare's Sonnets, declares that he must have visited Italy,
    basing this conclusion on the minute knowledge of certain
    Italian localities shown in some of his later plays. At home in
    Verona, Milan, Mantua, and Padua, Shakspeare is nowhere so much
    so as in Venice.</p>

    <p>It is impossible to think of Venice without remembering the
    poets; and the poet who is first remembered is Byron. If our
    thoughts are touched with gravity as they should be when we
    dwell upon the sombre aspects of Venice&mdash;when we look, as
    here, for example, on the Bridge of Sighs&mdash;we find
    ourselves repeating:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If we are in a gayer mood, as we are likely to be after
    looking at the brilliant carnival-scene which greets us at the
    threshold of the present number of <i>THE ALDINE</i>, we recall
    the opening passages of Byron's merry poem of "Beppo:"</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Of all the places where the Carnival</p>

            <p class="i2">Was most facetious in the days of
            yore,</p>

            <p>For dance, and song, and serenade, and ball,</p>

            <p class="i2">And masque, and mime, and mystery, and
            more</p>

            <p>Than I have time to tell now, or at all,</p>

            <p class="i2">Venice the bell from every city

    </div>

    <p>The Bridge of Sighs (to return to prose) is a long covered
    gallery, leading from the ducal palace to the old State prisons
    of Venice. It was frequently traversed, we may be sure, in the
    days of some of the Doges, to one of whom, our old friend, and
    Byron's&mdash;Marino Faliero&mdash;the erection of the ducal
    palace is sometimes falsely ascribed. Founded in the year 800,
    A.D., the ducal palace was afterwards destroyed five times, and
    each time arose from its ruins with increasing splendor until
    it became, what it is now, a stately marble building of the
    Saracenic style of architecture, with a grand staircase and
    noble halls, adorned with pictures by Titian, Tintoretto, Paul
    Veronese, and other famous masters.</p>

    <p>It would be difficult to find gloomier dungeons, even in the
    worst strongholds of despotism, than those in which the State
    prisoners of Venice were confined. These "pozzi," or wells,
    were sunk in the thick walls, under the flooring of the chamber
    at the foot of the Bridge of Sighs. There were twelve of them
    formerly, and they ran down three or four stories. The Venetian
    of old time abhorred them as deeply as his descendants, who, on
    the first arrival of the conquering French, attempted to block
    or break up the lowest of them, but were not entirely
    successful; for, when Byron was in Venice, it was not uncommon
    for adventurous tourists to descend by a trap-door, and crawl
    through holes, half choked by rubbish, to the depth of two
    stories below the first range. So says the writer of the
    <i>Notes</i> to the fourth canto of "Childe Harolde" (Byron's
    friend Hobhouse, if our memory serves), who adds, "If you are
    in want of consolation for the extinction of patrician power,
    perhaps you may find it there. Scarcely a ray of light glimmers
    into the narrow gallery which leads to the cells, and the
    places of confinement themselves are totally dark. A little
    hole in the wall admitted the damp air of the passages, and
    served for the introduction of the prisoner's food. A wooden
    pallet, about a foot or so from the ground, was the only
    furniture. The conductors tell you a light was not allowed. The
    cells are about five paces in length, two and a half in width,
    and seven feet in height. They are directly beneath one
    another, and respiration is somewhat difficult in the lower
    holes. Only one prisoner was found when the Republicans
    descended into these hideous recesses, and he is said to have
    been confined sixteen years." When the prisoner's hour came he
    was taken out and strangled in a cell upon the Bridge of
    Sighs!</p>

    <p>And this was in Venice! The grand old Republic which was
    once the greatest Power of Eastern Europe; the home of great
    artists and architects, renowned the world over for arts and
    arms; the Venice of "blind old Dandolo," who led her galleys to
    victory at the ripe old age of eighty; the Venice of Doge
    Foscari, whose son she tortured, imprisoned and murdered, and
    whose own paternal, patriotic, great heart she broke; the
    Venice of gay gallants, and noble, beautiful ladies; the Venice
    of mumming, masking, and the carnival; the bright, beautiful
    Venice of Shakspeare, Otway, and Byron; joyous, loving Venice;
    cruel, fatal Venice!</p>

    <p>MODERN SATIRE.&mdash;A satire on everything is a satire on
    nothing; it is mere absurdity. All contempt, all disrespect,
    implies something respected, as a standard to which it is
    referred; just as every valley implies a hill. The
    <i>persiflage</i> of the French and of fashionable worldlings,
    which turns into ridicule the exceptions and yet abjures the
    rules, is like Trinculo's government&mdash;its latter end
    forgets its beginning. Can there be a more mortal, poisonous
    consumption and asphyxy of the mind than this decline and
    extinction of all reverence?&mdash;<i>Jean

    <h2><a name="winter"
       id="winter"><i>WINTER PICTURES FROM THE POETS.</i></a></h2>

    <p>Although English Poetry abounds with pictures of the
    seasons, its Winter pictures are neither numerous, nor among
    its best. For one good snow-piece we can readily find twenty
    delicate Spring pictures&mdash;twinkling with morning dew, and
    odorous with the perfume of early flowers. It would be easy to
    make a large gallery of Summer pictures; and another gallery,
    equally large, which should contain only the misty skies, the
    dark clouds, and the falling leaves of Autumn. Not so with
    Winter scenes. Not that the English poets have not painted the
    last, and painted them finely, but that as a rule they have not
    taken kindly to the work. They prefer to do what Keats did in
    one of his poems, viz., make Winter a point of departure from
    which Fancy shall wing her way to brighter days:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Fancy, high-commissioned; send her!</p>

            <p>She has vassals to attend her,</p>

            <p>She will bring, in spite of frost,</p>

            <p>Beauties that the earth hath lost,</p>

            <p>She will bring thee, all together,</p>

            <p>All delights of summer weather."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But we must not let Keats come between us and the few among
    his fellows who have sung of Winter for us. Above all, we must
    not let him keep his and our master, Shakspeare, waiting:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"When icicles hang by the wall,</p>

            <p class="i2">And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,</p>

            <p>And Tom bears logs into the hall,</p>

            <p class="i2">And milk comes frozen home in pail,</p>

            <p>When blood is nipped, and ways be foul,</p>

            <p>Then nightly sings the staring owl,</p>

            <p class="i10">To-whoo;</p>

            <p>To-whit, to-whoo, a merry note,</p>

            <p>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"When all aloud the wind doth blow,</p>

            <p class="i2">And coughing drowns the parson's saw,</p>

            <p>And birds sit brooding in the snow,</p>

            <p class="i2">And Marian's nose looks red and raw.</p>

            <p>When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,</p>

            <p>Then nightly sings the staring owl,</p>

            <p class="i10">To-whoo;</p>

            <p>To-whit, to-whoo, a merry note,</p>

            <p>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>From Shakspeare to Thomson is something of a descent, but we
    must make it before we can find any Winter poetry worth
    quoting. Here is a picture, ready-made, for Landseer to put
    into form and color:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"There, warm together pressed, the trooping deer</p>

            <p>Sleep on the new-fallen snows; and scarce his
            head</p>

            <p>Raised o'er the heapy wreath, the branching elk</p>

            <p>Lies slumbering sullen in the white abyss.</p>

            <p>The ruthless hunter wants nor dogs nor toils,</p>

            <p>Nor with the dread of sounding bows he drives</p>

            <p>The fearful flying race: with ponderous clubs,</p>

            <p>As weak against the mountain-heaps they push</p>

            <p>Their beating breast in vain, and piteous bray,</p>

            <p>He lays them quivering on the ensanguined snows,</p>

            <p>And with loud shouts rejoicing bears them home."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Cowper is superior to Thomson as a painter of Winter,
    although it is doubtful whether he was by nature the better
    poet. Here is one of his pictures:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The cattle mourn in corners, where the fence</p>

            <p>Screens them, and seem half petrified with sleep</p>

            <p>In unrecumbent sadness. There they wait</p>

            <p>Their wonted fodder; not like hungering man,</p>

            <p>Fretful if unsupplied; but silent, meek,</p>

            <p>And patient of the slow-paced swain's delay.</p>

            <p>He, from the stack, carves out the accustomed
            load,</p>

            <p>Deep plunging, and again deep plunging oft,</p>

            <p>The broad keen knife into the solid mass:</p>

            <p>Smooth as a wall, the upright remnant stands,</p>

            <p>With such undeviating and even force</p>

            <p>He severs it away: no needless care,</p>

            <p>Lest storms should overset the leaning pile</p>

            <p>Deciduous, or its own unbalanced weight.</p>

            <p>Forth goes the woodman, leaving, unconcerned,</p>

            <p>The cheerful haunts of man, to wield the axe</p>

            <p>And drive the wedge in yonder forest drear,</p>

            <p>From morn to eve his solitary task.</p>

            <p>Shaggy, and lean, and shrewd, with pointed ears</p>

            <p>And tail cropped short, half lurcher and half
            cur,</p>

            <p>His dog attends him. Close behind his heel</p>

            <p>Now creeps he slow; and now, with many a frisk,</p>

            <p>Wide scampering, snatches up the drifted snow</p>

            <p>With ivory teeth, or ploughs it with his snout;</p>

            <p>Then shakes his powdered coat, and barks for
            joy.</p>

            <p>Heedless of all his pranks, the sturdy churl</p>

            <p>Moves right toward the mark; nor stops for
            aught,</p>

            <p>But now and then, with pressure of his thumb</p>

            <p>To adjust the fragrant charge of a short tube</p>

            <p>That fumes beneath his nose: the trailing cloud</p>

            <p>Streams far behind him, scenting all the air.</p>

            <p>Now from the roost, or from the neighboring
            pale,</p>

            <p>Where, diligent to cast the first faint gleam</p>

            <p>Of smiling day, they gossiped side by side,</p>

            <p>Come trooping at the housewife's well-known call</p>

            <p>The feathered tribes domestic. Half on wing,</p>

            <p>And half on foot, they brush the fleecy flood,</p>

            <p>Conscious and fearful of too deep a plunge.</p>

            <p>The sparrows peep, and quit the sheltering
            eaves,</p>

            <p>To seize the fair occasion; well they eye</p>

            <p>The scattered grain, and thievishly resolved</p>

            <p>To escape the impending famine, often scared</p>

            <p>As oft return, a pert voracious kind.</p>

            <p>Clean riddance quickly made, one only care</p>

            <p>Remains to each, the search of sunny nook,</p>

            <p>Or shed impervious to the blast. Resigned</p>

            <p>To sad necessity, the cock foregoes</p>

            <p>His wonted strut; and, wading at their head,</p>

            <p>With well-considered steps, seems to resent</p>

            <p>His altered gait and stateliness retrenched."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The American poets have excelled their English brethren in
    painting the outward aspects of Winter. Here is Mr. Emerson's
    description of a snow storm:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Announced by all the trumpets of the sky</p>

            <p>Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,</p>

            <p>Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air</p>

            <p>Hides hills and woods, the river, and the

            <p class="i10">"Look! the massy trunks</p>

            <p>Are cased in the pure crystal; each light spray</p>

            <p>Nodding and tinkling in the breath of heaven,</p>

            <p>Is studded with its trembling water-drops,</p>

            <p>And all their sluices sealed. All, all is light;</p>

            <p>Light without shade. But all shall pass away</p>

            <p>With the next sun. From numberless vast trunks,</p>

            <p>Loosened, the crashing ice shall make a sound</p>

            <p>Like the far roar of rivers, and the eve</p>

    <p>Winter, itself, has never been more happily impersonated
    than by dear old Spenser. We meant to close with his portrait
    of Winter, but, on second thoughts, we give, as more
    seasonable, his description of January. The fourth line can
    hardly fail to remind the reader of the second line of

    Shakspeare borrowed from Spenser, Spenser from Shakspeare, or

    <h2><a name="pavilions"
       id="pavilions"><i>THE PAVILIONS ON THE LAKE.</i></a></h2>

    <h3>From the French of Theophile Gautier.</h3>

    <p>In the province of Canton, several miles from the city,
    there once lived two rich Chinese merchants, retired from
    business. One of them was named Tou, the other Kouan. Both were
    possessed of great riches, and were persons of much consequence
    in the community.</p>

    <p>Tou and Kouan were distant relatives, and from early youth
    had lived and worked side by side. Bound by ties of great
    affection, they had built their homes near together, and every
    evening they met with a few select friends to pass the hours in
    delightful intercourse. Both possessed of much talent, they
    vied with each other in the production of exquisite Chinese
    handiwork, and spent the evenings in tracing poetry and fancy
    designs on rice-paper as they drank each other's success in
    tiny glasses of delicate cordial. But their characters,
    apparently so harmonious, as time went on grew more and more
    apart; they were like an almond tree, growing as one stem,
    until little by little the branches divide so that the topmost
    twigs are far from each other&mdash;half sending their bitter
    perfume through the whole garden, while the other half scatter
    their snow-white flowers outside the garden wall.</p>

    <p>From year to year Tou grew more serious; his figure
    increased in dignity, even his double chin wore a solemn
    expression, and he spent his whole time composing moral
    inscriptions to hang over the doors of his pavilion.</p>

    <p>Kouan, on the contrary, grew jolly as his years increased.
    He sang more gaily than ever in praise of wine, flowers, and
    birds. His spirit, unburdened by vulgar cares, was light like a
    young man's, and he dreamed of nothing but pure enjoyment.</p>

    <p>Little by little an intense hatred sprang up between the
    friends. They could not meet without indulging in bitter
    sarcasm. They were like two hedges of brambles, bristling with
    sharp thorns. At last, things came to such a pass that they
    could no longer endure each other's society, and each hung a
    tablet by the door of his dwelling, stating that no person from
    the neighboring house would be allowed to cross the threshold
    on any pretext whatever.</p>

    <p>They would have been glad to move their houses to different
    parts of the country, but, unhappily, this was not possible.
    Tou even tried to sell his property but he set such an
    unreasonable price that no buyer appeared, and he was,
    moreover, unwilling to leave all the treasures he had
    accumulated there&mdash;the sculptured wainscotting, the
    polished panels, like mirrors, the transparent windows, the
    gilded lattice-work, the bamboo lounges, the vases of rare
    porcelain, the red and black lacquered cabinets, and the cases
    full of books of ancient poetry. It was hard to give up to
    strangers the garden where he had planted shade and fruit trees
    with his own hands, and where, each spring he had watched the
    opening of the flowers; where in short, each object was bound
    to his heart by ties delicate as the finest silk, but strong as
    iron chains.</p>

    <p>In the days of their friendship, Tou and Kouan had each
    built a pavilion in his garden, on the shore of a lake, common
    to both estates. It had been a great delight to sit in their
    separate balconies and exchange friendly salutations while they
    smoked opium in pipes of delicate porcelain. But after becoming
    enemies they built a wall which divided the lake into two equal
    portions. The water was so deep that the wall was supported on
    a series of arches, through which the water flowed freely,
    reflecting upon its placid surface the rival pavilions.</p>

    <p>These pavilions were exquisite specimens of Chinese
    architecture. The roofs, covered with tiling, round and
    brilliant as the scales which glisten on the sides of a
    gold-fish, were supported upon red and black pillars which
    rested on a solid foundation, richly ornamented with porcelain
    slabs bearing all manner of artistic designs. A railing ran all
    around, formed by a graceful intermingling of branches and
    flowers wrought in ivory. The interior was not less sumptuous.
    On the walls were inscribed verses of celebrated Chinese poems,
    elegantly written in perpendicular lines, with golden
    characters on a lacquered background. Shades of delicately
    carved ivory, softened the light to a faint opal tint, and all
    around stood pots of orchis, peonies, and daisies, which filled
    the air with delicious perfume. Curtains of rich silk were
    draped over the entrance, and on the marble tables within were
    scattered fans, tooth-picks, ebony pipes, and pencils with all
    conveniences for writing.</p>

    <p>All around the pavilions were picturesque grounds
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span> of rock, among whose clefts
       grew clumps of willows, their long green twigs swaying on
       the surface of the water. Under the crystal waves sported
       myriads of gold-fish, and ducks with gay plumage floated
       among the broad, shining leaves of water-lilies. Except in
       the very centre of the pool, where the depth of the water
       prevented the growth of aquatic plants, the whole surface
       was covered with these leaves, like a carpet of soft green
       velvet.</p>

    <p>Before the unsightly wall had been placed there by the
    hostile owners, it was impossible to find a more picturesque
    spot in the whole empire, and even now no philosopher would
    have wished for a more retired and delicious retreat in which
    to pass his days.</p>

    <p>Both Tou and Kouan felt deeply the loss of the enchanting
    prospect, and gazed sadly upon the barren wall which rose
    before their eyes, but each consoled himself with the idea that
    his neighbor was as badly off as himself.</p>

    <p>Things went on in this way for several years. Grass and
    weeds choked up the pathway between the two houses, and
    brambles and branches of low shrubs intertwined across it, as
    though they would bar all communication forever. It appeared as
    if the plants understood the quarrel between the two old
    friends, and took delight in perpetuating it.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile the wives of both Tou and Kouan were both blessed
    each with a child. Madame Tou became the mother of a charming
    girl, and Madame Kouan of the handsomest boy in the world. Each
    family was ignorant of the happy event which had brought joy
    into the home of the other, for although their houses were so
    near together the families were as far apart as if they had
    been separated by the great wall of the empire, or the ocean
    itself. What mutual friends they still possessed, never alluded
    to the affairs of one in the house of the other; even the
    servants had been forbidden to exchange words with each other,
    under pain of death.</p>

    <p>The boy was named Tchin-Sing, and the girl Ju-Kiouan, that
    is to say, Jasper and Pearl. Their perfect beauty fully
    justified the choice of their names. As they grew old enough to
    take notice of their surroundings, the unsightly wall attracted
    their attention, and each inquired of their parents why that
    strange barrier was placed across the centre of such a charming
    sheet of water, and to whom belonged the great trees of which
    they could see the topmost boughs.</p>

    <p>Each was told that on the farther side of the wall was the
    habitation of a strange and wicked family, and that it had been
    placed there as a protection against such disagreeable
    neighbors.</p>

    <p>This explanation was sufficient for the children. They grew
    accustomed to the sight and thought no more about it.</p>

    <p>Ju-Kiouan grew in grace and beauty. She was skilled in all
    lady-like accomplishments. The butterflies which she
    embroidered upon satin appeared to live and beat their wings,
    and one could almost hear the song of the birds which grew
    under her fingers, and smell the perfume of the flowers she
    wrought upon canvas. She knew the "Book of Odes" by heart, and
    could repeat the five rules of life without missing a word. Her
    handwriting was perfection, and she composed in all the
    different styles of Chinese poetry. Her poems were upon all
    those delicate themes which would attract the mind of a pure
    young girl; upon the return of the swallows, the daisies, the
    weeping willows and similar topics, and were of such merit as
    to win much praise from the wise men of the country.</p>

    <p>Tchin-Sing was not less forward in his accomplishments, and
    his name stood at the head of his class. Although he was very
    young he had already gained the right to wear the black cap of
    the wise men, and all the mothers in the country about wished
    him for a son-in-law. But Tchin-Sing had but one answer to all
    proposals; it was too soon, and he desired his liberty for some
    time to come. He refused the hand of Hon-Giu, of Oma, and other
    beautiful young girls. Never was a young man more courted and
    more overwhelmed with sweets and flowers than he, but his heart
    remained insensible to all attractions. Not on account of its
    coldness, for he appeared full of longing for an object to
    adore. His heart seemed fixed upon some memory, some dream,
    perhaps, for whose realization he was waiting and hoping. It
    was all in vain to tell him of beautiful tresses, languishing
    eyes, and soft hands waiting for his acceptance. He listened
    with a distracted air, as if thinking of other things.</p>

    <p>Ju-Kiouan was not less difficult to please. She refused all
    suitors for her hand. This did not salute her gracefully, that
    was not dainty in his habits; one had a bad handwriting,
    another composed poor verses; in short all had some defect. She
    drew amusing caricatures of everyone, which made her parents
    laugh, and show the door to the unlucky lover in the most
    polite manner possible.</p>

    <p>At last the parents of both young people became alarmed at
    the continued refusal of their children to marry, and the
    mothers commenced to follow the subject in their dreams. One
    night Madame Kouan dreamed that she saw a pearl of wonderful
    purity reposing on the breast of her son. On the other hand,
    Madame Tou dreamed that on her daughter's forehead sparkled a
    jasper of inestimable value. Much consultation was held as to
    the significance of these dreams. Madame Kouan's was thought to
    imply that her son would win the highest honors of the Imperial
    Academy, while Madame Tou's might signify that her daughter
    would find some untold treasure in the garden. These
    interpretations, however, did not satisfy the two mothers,
    whose whole minds were bent upon the happy marriage of their
    children. Unfortunately both Tchin-Sing and Ju-Kiouan persisted
    more obstinately than ever in their refusal to listen to the
    subject.</p>

    <p>As young people are not usually so averse to marriage, the
    parents suspected some secret attachment, but a few days'
    careful watching sufficed to prove that Tchin-Sing was paying
    court to no young girl, and that no lover was to be seen under
    the balcony of Ju-Kiouan.</p>

    <p>At length both mothers decided to consult the bronze oracle
    in the temple of Fo. After burning gilt paper and perfume
    before the oracle, Madame Tou received the unsatisfactory
    answer that, until the jasper appeared, the pearl would unite
    with no one, and Madame Kouan was told the jasper would take
    nothing to his bosom but the pearl. Both women went sadly
    homeward in deeper perplexity than ever.</p>

    <p>One day Ju-Kiouan was leaning pensively on the balcony of
    her pavilion, precisely at the same time when Tchin-Sing was
    standing by his. The day was clear as crystal, and not a cloud
    floated in the blue space above. There was not sufficient wind
    to move the lightest twigs of the willows, and the surface of
    the water was glistening and placid as a mirror, only
    disturbed, here and there, when some tiny gold-fish leaped for
    an instant into the sunshine. The trees and grassy banks were
    reflected so distinctly that it was impossible to tell where
    the real world left off, and the land of dreams began.
    Ju-Kiouan was amusing herself watching the beauteous
    water-picture when her eyes fell upon that portion of the lake,
    near the wall, where, with all the clearness of reality, was
    the reflection of the pavilion on the opposite shore.</p>

    <p>She had never noticed it before, and what was her surprise
    to behold an exact reproduction of the one where she was
    standing, the gilded roof, the red and black pillars, and all
    the beauteous drapery about the doors. She would have been able
    to read the inscription upon the tablets, had they not been
    reversed. But what surprised her more than all was to see,
    leaning on the balcony, a figure which, if it had not come from
    the other side of the lake, she would have taken for her own
    reflection. It was the mirrored image of Tchin-Sing. At first
    she took it for the reflection of a girl, as he was dressed in
    robes according to the fashion of the time. As the heat was
    intense, he had thrown off his student's cap, and his hair fell
    about his fresh, beardless face. But soon Ju-Kiouan recognized,
    from the violent beating of her heart, that the reflection in
    the water was not that of a young girl.</p>

    <p>Until then she had believed that the earth contained no
    being created for her, and had often indulged in pensive revery
    over her loneliness. Never, said she, shall I take my place as
    a link between the past and future of my family, but I shall
    enter among the shadows as a lonely shade.</p>

    <p>But when she beheld the reflection in the water, she found
    that her beauty had a sister, or, more properly speaking, a
    brother. Far from being displeased to discover that her beauty
    was not unrivaled, she was filled with intense joy. Her heart
    was beating and throbbing with love for another, and in that
    instant Ju-Kiouan's whole life was changed. It was foolish in
    her to fall violently in love with a reflection, of whose
    reality she knew nothing, but after all she was only acting
    like nearly all young girls who take a husband for his white
    teeth or his curly hair, knowing nothing whatever of his real
    character.</p>

    <p>Tchin-Sing had also perceived the charming reflection of the
    young girl. "I am dreaming," he cried. "That beautiful image
    upon the water is the combination of sunshine and the perfume
    of many flowers. I recognize it well. It is the reflection of
    the image within my own heart, the divine unknown whom I have
    worshiped all my life."</p>

    <p>Tchin-Sing was aroused from his monologue by the voice of
    his father, who called him to come at once to the grand
    saloon.</p>

    <p>"My son," said he, "here is a very rich and very learned man
    who seeks you as a husband for his daughter. The young girl has
    imperial blood in her veins, is of a rare beauty, and possesses
    all the qualities necessary to make her husband happy."</p>

    <p>Tchin-Sing, whose heart was bursting with love for the
    reflection seen from the pavilion, refused decidedly. His
    father, carried away with passion, heaped upon him the most
    violent imprecations.</p>

    <p>"Undutiful child," said he, "if you persist in your
    obstinacy, I will have you confined in one of the strongest
    fortresses of the empire, where you will see nothing but the
    sea beating against the rocks, and the mountains covered with
    mist. There you will have leisure to reflect, and repent of
    your wicked conduct."</p>

    <p>These threats did not frighten Tchin-Sing in the least. He
    quickly replied that he would accept for his wife the first
    maiden who touched his heart, and until then he should listen
    to no one.</p>

    <p>The next day, at the same hour, he went to the pavilion on
    the lake, and, leaning on the balcony, eagerly watched for the
    beloved reflection. In a few moments he saw it glisten in the
    water, beauteous as a boquet of submerged flowers.</p>

    <p>A radiant smile broke over the face of the reflection, which
    proved to Tchin-Sing that his presence was not unpleasant to
    the lovely unknown. But as it was impossible to hold
    communication with a reflection whose substance is invisible,
    he made a sign that he would write, and vanished into the
    interior of the pavilion. He soon reappeared, bearing in his
    hand a silvered paper, upon which he had written a declaration
    of love in seven-syllabled stanzas. He carefully folded his
    verses and placed them in the cup of a white flower, which he
    rolled in a leaf of the water-lily, and placed the whole
    tenderly upon the surface of the lake.</p>

    <p>A light breeze wafted the lover's message through the arches
    of the wall, and it floated so near Ju-Kiouan that she had only
    to stretch out her hand to receive it. Fearful of being seen
    she returned to her private boudoir, where she read with great
    delight the expressions of love written by Tchin-Sing. Her joy
    was all the greater, as she recognized from the exquisite
    hand-writing and choice versification that the writer was a man
    of culture and talent. And when she read his signature, the
    significance of which she perceived at once, remembering her
    mother's dream, she felt that heaven had sent her the long
    desired companion.</p>

    <p>The next day the breeze blew in a different direction, so
    that Ju-Kiouan was able to send an answer in verse by the same
    subtle messenger, by which, notwithstanding her girlish
    modesty, it was easy to see that she returned the love of
    Tchin-Sing.</p>

    <p>On reading the signature, Tchin-Sing could not repress an
    exclamation of surprise and delight. "The pearl," said he,
    "that is the precious jewel my mother saw glittering on my
    bosom. I must at once entreat this young girl's hand of her
    parents, for she is the wife appointed for me by the
    oracle."</p>

    <p>As he was preparing to go, he suddenly remembered the
    dislike between the two families, and the prohibitions
    inscribed upon the tablet over the entrance. Determined to win
    his prize at any cost, he resolved to confide the whole history
    to his mother. Ju-Kiouan had also told her love to Madame Tou.
    The names of Pearl and Jasper troubled the good matrons so much
    that, not daring to set themselves against what appeared to be
    the will of the gods, they both went again to the temple of
    Fo.</p>

    <p>The bronze oracle replied that this marriage was in reality
    the true interpretation of the dreams, and that to prevent it
    would be to incur the eternal anger of the gods. Touched by the
    entreaties of the mothers, and also by slight mutual advances,
    the two fathers gave way and consented to a reconciliation of
    the families. The two old friends, on meeting each other again,
    were astonished to find what frivolous causes had separated
    them for so many years, and mourned sincerely over all the
    pleasure they had lost in being deprived of each other's
    society. The marriage of the children was celebrated with much
    rejoicing, and the Jasper and the Pearl were no longer obliged
    to hold intercourse by means of a reflection on the water. The
    wall was removed, and the wavelets rippled placidly between the
    two pavilions on the lake.</p>

    <p>A line of Walter Savage Landor's, a poet for poets, was an
    especial favorite with Southey, and, we believe, with Lamb. It
    occurs in "Gebir," and drops from the lips of one of its
    characters, who, being suddenly shown the sea, exclaims,</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Is this the mighty ocean?&mdash;is this all?"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The feeling which underlies this line is generally the first
    emotion we have when brought face to face with the stupendous
    forms of Nature. It is the feeling inspired by mountains, the
    first sight of which is disappointing. They are grand, but not
    quite what we were led to expect from pictures and books, and,
    still more, from our own imaginations. The more we see
    mountains, the more they grow upon us, until, finally, they are
    clothed with a grandeur not, in all cases, belonging to
    them&mdash;our Mount Washingtons over-topping the Alps, and the
    Alps the Himmalayas. The poets assist us in thus magnifying
    them.</p>

    <p>The American poets have translated the mountains of their
    native land into excellent verse. Everybody remembers Mr.
    Bryant's "Monument Mountain," for its touching story, and its
    clearly-defined descriptions of scenery.</p>

    <p>Mr. Stedman has a mountain of his own, though perhaps only
    in Dream-land; and Mr. Bayard Taylor has a whole range of them,
    the sight of which once filled him with rapture:</p>

    <h2><a name="mandarin"
       id="mandarin"><i>A MANDARIN.</i></a></h2>

    <h3>From the French of Auguste Vitu.</h3>

    <p>It was Saturday night, and the pavement sparkled with frost
    diamonds under flashing lights and echoing steps in the opera
    quarter. Tinkling carnival bells and wild singing resounded
    from all the carriages dashing towards Rue Lepelletier; the
    shops were only half shut, and Paris, wide awake, reveled in a
    fairy-night frolic.</p>

    <p>And yet, Felix d'Aubremel, one of the bright applauded
    heroes of those orgies, seemed in no mood to answer their mad
    challenge. Plunged in a deep armchair, hands drooping and feet
    on the fender, he was sunk in sombre revery. An open book lay
    near him, and a letter was flung, furiously crumpled, on the
    floor.</p>

    <p>An orphan at the age of twelve, Felix had watched his
    mother's slow death through ten years of suffering. The Marquis
    Gratien d'Aubremel, ruined by reckless dissipation, and driven
    by necessity, rather than love, into a marriage with an English
    heiress, Margaret Malden, deserted her, like the wretch he was,
    as soon as the last of her dowry melted away. A common story
    enough, and ending in as common a close. D'Aubremel sailed for
    the Indies to retrieve his fortune, and met death there by
    yellow fever. So that the sad lessons of Felix's family life
    stimulated to excess his innate leaning towards
    misanthropy&mdash;if that name may define a resistless urgency
    of belief in the appearances of evil, linked with a doubt of
    the reality of good. Probably, at heart, he believed himself
    incapable of a bad action, but he would take no oath to such a
    conviction, since by his theory every man must yield under
    certain circumstances, attacking powerfully his personal
    interest, while threatening slight danger of failure or
    detection. This style of thought, set off by a fair share of
    witty expression and ever-ready impertinence, gave Felix a kind
    of ascendancy in his circle of intimates&mdash;but naturally it
    gained him no friends. Common reputation grows out of words
    rather than actions, and Felix suffered the just penalty of his
    sceptical fancies. They cost him more than they were worth, as
    he had just learned by sad experience.</p>

    <p>He had chanced to make the acquaintance of a rich
    manufacturer, Montmorot by name, whose daughter Ernestine was
    pleased with the devotion of a charming young fellow, who
    mingled the rather reckless grace of French cleverness with a
    reserved style and refined pride gained from the English blood
    of the Maldens. For his part, Felix really loved the girl, and
    had let his impatience, that very day, carry him into a step
    that failed to move the elder Montmorot's inflexibility. He
    refused absolutely to give his daughter to a man without
    fortune or prospects. Felix was crushed, his hopes all
    shattered at a blow, by this answer, though he had a thousand
    reasons to expect it. And at what a moment! A half-unfolded red
    ticket, stuffed with disgusting threats, peeped out from
    between the wall and his sofa. The officers of justice had paid
    him a little visit. He got into a passion with himself.</p>

    <p>"Pshaw," he cried, "confound all scruples! If I had been
    less in love I should be Ernestine's husband now. With a pretty
    wife, one I am so fond of, too, I should have fortune,
    position, and the luxury indispensable to my life&mdash;now, I
    don't know where to lay my head to-morrow. To-morrow, at ten
    o'clock, the sheriff will seize everything&mdash;everything,
    from that Troyou sketch to that china monster, nodding his
    frightful sneering head at me. They will carry off this casket
    that was my father's&mdash;this locket, with the hair
    of&mdash;of&mdash;what the deuce was her name? Poor girl! how
    she loved me! And now all that is left of her
    vanishes&mdash;even her name!</p>

    <p>"What, nothing? no hope? Not even one of those silly
    impulses that used to drive me out into the streets when
    everybody else was abed, with the firm conviction that at some
    crossing, in some gutter, some unknown deity must have dropped
    a fat pocket-book, on purpose for me! I believed in something,
    then&mdash;even in lost pocket-books. And now, now! I would
    commit no such follies as that, but I believe I could be guilty
    of even worse things, if crime, common, low, contemptible,
    shameful crime, were not forbidden to the son of the Marquis
    d'Aubremel and Margaret Malden.</p>

    <p>"Oh, great genius!" he went on, taking up the open book near
    him, "great philosopher, called a sophist by the
    ignorant&mdash;how deep a truth you uttered in writing these
    lines, that I never read over without a shudder: 'Imagine a
    Chinese mandarin, living in a fabulous country three thousand
    leagues away, whom you have never seen and shall never
    see&mdash;imagine, moreover, that the death of this mandarin,
    this man, almost a myth, would make you a millionaire, and that
    you have but to lift your finger, at home, in France, to bring
    about his death, without the possibility of ever being called
    to account for it by any one; say, what would you do?'</p>

    <p>"That fearful passage must have made many men
    dream&mdash;and does not Bianchon, that great materialist, so
    well painted by Balzac, confess that he has got as far as his
    thirty-third mandarin? What a St. Bartholomew of mandarins, if
    my philosopher's supposition could grow into a truth!"</p>

    <p>Felix ceased his soliloquy, and bent his head to let the
    storm raised in his soul by the atheist philosopher pass over.
    His bad instincts, aroused, spoke louder at that instant than
    reason, louder than reality. His glance fell on the
    chimney-piece, where a porcelain figure, the grotesque <i>chef
    d'oeuvre</i> of some great Chinese artist, leered at him with
    its everlasting grin. The young man smiled. "Perhaps that is
    the likeness of a mandarin&mdash;bulbous nose, hanging cheeks,
    moustaches drooping like plumes, a peaked head, knotty
    hands&mdash;a regular deformity. Reflecting on the ugliness of
    that idiotic race, there is much to be urged by way of excuse
    for people who kill mandarins."</p>

    <p>Some persistent thought evidently haunted Felix's mind.
    Again he drove it off, and again it beset him.</p>

    <p>"Pshaw!" he exclaimed, after a last brief struggle, "I am
    alone, and out of sorts. I will amuse myself with a carnival
    freak, a mere theoretic and philosophic piece of nonsense. I
    have tried many worse ones. It wants a quarter to twelve. I
    give myself fifteen minutes to study my spells. Let me see,
    what mandarin shall I murder? I don't know any, and I have no
    peerage list of the Flowery Empire. Let me try the
    newspapers."</p>

    <p>It was in the height of the English war with China. On the
    seventh column of the paper our hero found a proclamation
    signed by the imperial commissioners, Lin, Lou, Lun, and
    Li.</p>

    <p>"Here goes for Li," he said to himself. "He is likely to be
    the youngest."</p>

    <p>The clock began to strike, announcing the hour. Felix placed
    himself solemnly before the mirror, and said aloud, in a grave
    tone: "If the death of Mandarin Li will make me rich and
    powerful, whatever may come of it, I vote for the death of
    Mandarin Li." He lifted his finger&mdash;at that instant the
    porcelain figure rocked on its base, and fell in fragments at
    Felix's feet. The glass reflected his startled face. He
    thrilled for an instant with superstitious terror, but
    recollecting that his finger had touched the fragile figure, he
    accounted for it as an accident, and went to bed and to such
    repose as a debtor can enjoy with an execution hanging over his
    head.</p>

    <p>Masks and dominos made the street merry under his window.
    The opera ball was unusually brilliant, experts said, and
    nothing made the Parisians aware that on the night of January
    12th, 1840, Felix d'Aubremel had passed sentence of death on
    Chinaman Li, son of Mung, son of Tseu, a literate mandarin of
    the 114th class.</p>

    <p>Nine months later Felix d'Aubremel was living in furnished
    lodgings in an alley off the Rue St. Pierre, and living by
    borrowing. The gentlemanly sceptic owed his landlady a good
    deal of money; his clothes were aged past wearing, and his
    tailor had long ago broken off all relations with him. The
    Marquis d'Aubremel was within a hairsbreadth of that utterly
    crushed state that ends in madness, or in suicide&mdash;which
    is only a variety of madness.</p>

    <p>One morning while sitting in the glass cage that leads to
    the staircase of every lodging-house, waiting to beg another
    respite from his landlady, he took up a newspaper, and the
    following notice was lucky enough to catch his attention.</p>

    <p>"Chiusang, 12th January, 1840. Hostilities have broken out
    between England and the Celestial Empire. The sudden and
    inexplicable death of Mandarin Li, the only member of the
    council who opposed the violent and warlike projects of Lin,
    led to unfortunate events. At the first attack the Chinese
    fled, with the basest want of pluck, but in their retreat they
    murdered several English merchants, and among them an old
    resident, Richard Maiden, who leaves an estate of half a
    million sterling. The heirs of the deceased are requested to
    communicate with William Harrison, Solicitor, Lincoln's
    Inn."</p>

    <p>"My uncle!" cried Felix. "Alas, I have killed my uncle and
    Mandarin Li."</p>

    <p>He had not a penny to pay for his traveling expenses to
    London; but, on producing his certificate of birth and the
    newspaper article, his landlady easily negotiated for him with
    an honest broker, who advanced him a thousand francs to arrange
    his affairs, without interest, upon his note for a trifle of
    eighteen hundred, payable in six weeks.</p>

    <p>Eight days after reaching London, Felix, established in a
    fashionable hotel, was awaiting with nervous eagerness the
    first instalment of a million, the proceeds of a cargo of teas,
    sold under the direction of Mr. Harrison. He was too restless
    for thought, burning with impatience to take possession of his
    property, to handle his wealth, and, as it were, to verify his
    dream. Yet the fact was indisputable. Richard Malden's death,
    and his own relationship to the intestate had been legally
    proved and established. Felix d'Aubremel regularly and
    assuredly inherited a fortune, and he had no doubts nor
    scruples on that point.</p>

    <p>A servant interrupted his reflections, announcing his
    solicitor's clerk. "Why does not Mr. Harrison come himself?" he
    was on the point of asking, but amazement at the clerk's
    appearance took away his breath. He was a shriveled little
    object, slight, bony, crooked and hideous, with a monstrous
    head and round eyes, a bald skull, a flat nose, a mouth from
    ear to ear, and a little jutting paunch that looked like a
    sack.</p>

    <p>"I bring the Marquis d'Aubremel the monies he is expecting,"
    said the man, and his voice, shrill and silvery, like a musical
    box or the bell of a clock, impressed Felix painfully. The
    voice grated on the nerves. "I have drawn a receipt in regular
    form," said Felix, extending his hand. But the solicitor's
    clerk leaned his back against the door, without stirring a
    step. "Well, sir," Felix exclaimed with a convulsive effort.
    The man approached slowly, scarcely moving his feet, as if
    sliding across the floor. His right hand was buried in his coat
    pocket; he held his head bent down, and his lips moved
    inaudibly. At last he pulled from his pocket a large bundle of
    banknotes, bills and papers, drew near the window, and began to
    count them carefully.</p>

    <p>Felix was then struck by a strange phenomenon that might
    well inspire undefined terror. Standing directly in front of
    the window, the clerk's figure cast no shadow, though the sun's
    rays fell full upon it, and through his human body, translucent
    as rock crystal, Felix plainly saw the houses across the
    street. Then his eyes seemed to be suddenly unsealed. The
    clerk's black coat took colors, blue, green, and scarlet; it
    lengthened out into the folds of a robe, and blazed with the
    dazzling image of the fire-dragon, the son of Buddha; a lock of
    stiff grayish hair sprouted like a short tuft out of his
    yellowish skull; his round tawny eyes rolled with frightful
    rapidity in their sockets.</p>

    <p>Felix recognized Li, son of Mung, son of Tseu, the literate
    mandarin of the 114th class. The murderer had never seen his
    victim, but could not doubt his identity a moment, thanks to
    the marvelous resemblance between the solicitor's clerk and the
    china monster that dropped into bits at his feet the night of
    January 12th, 1840.</p>

    <p>Meantime the man had done counting his package, and held it
    out to Felix, saying, in his grating, vibrating tones,
    "Monsieur le Marquis, here are forty thousand pounds sterling;
    please to give me your receipt." And Felix heard the voice say
    in a shriller under-key, "Felix, here is an instalment of the
    million, the price of your crime. Felix, my assassin, take this
    money from my hand."</p>

    <p>"From my hand," echoed a thousand fine voices, quivering all
    through the air of the room.</p>

    <p>"No, no," cried Felix, pushing the clerk away, "the money
    would burn me! Begone with you!"</p>

    <p>He dropped exhausted into a chair, half suffocated, with
    drops of sweat rolling down his convulsed face. The man bowed
    to the floor, and slowly moved away backwards. With every
    gradual step Felix saw his natural shape return. The rays of
    the autumn sun ceased to light up that mysterious apparition,
    and only his attorney's humble clerk stood before Felix. With a
    rush overpowering his will, Felix dashed after the old man,
    already across the threshold, and overtook him on the
    staircase.</p>

    <p>"My papers!" he shouted imperiously. "Here they are, sir,"
    said the old fellow quietly.</p>

    <p>Felix regained his room, bolted the door, and counted the
    immense sum contained in the pocket-book with excitement
    bordering on frenzy. Then he bathed his burning head with cold
    water, and threw an anxious look around the room.</p>

    <p>"I must have had an attack of fever," he muttered.</p>

    <p>"Mandarins don't rise from the dead, and a man can't kill
    another by simply lifting his finger. So my philosopher talked
    like one who knows nothing of moral experience. If the fancy of
    an unreal crime almost drove me mad, what must be the remorse
    of an actual criminal?"</p>

    <p>The same evening Felix ordered post horses and set out for
    France.</p>

    <p>Some months later, Monsieur Montmorot, chevalier of the
    legion of honor, gave a grand dinner to celebrate his
    daughter's betrothal with the Marquis Felix d'Aubremel, one of
    the noblest names in France, as he styled it. The contract
    settling a part of his fortune on his daughter Ernestine was
    signed at nine in the evening. The Monday following the pair
    presented themselves before the civil officials to solemnize
    their marriage by due legal ceremonies.</p>

    <p>Felix, a prey to the strange hallucination that incessantly
    pursued him, saw a likeness between the official and the
    Chinese figure he had awkwardly thrown down and broken one
    night long ago. Presently his face darkened, and his eyes began
    to burn. Behind the magistrate's blue spectacles he caught the
    gleam and roll of the tawny eyes belonging to Mr. Harrison's
    clerk, to Li, son of Mung, son of Tseu.</p>

    <p>When at length the magistrate put the formal question,
    "Felix Etienne d'Aubremel, do you take for your wife Ernestine
    Juliette Montmorot," Felix heard a shrill ringing voice say,
    "Felix, I give you your wife with my hand&mdash;my hand."</p>

    <p>The official repeated the question more loudly. "With my
    hand&mdash;my hand," whispered a thousand mocking little
    voices.</p>

    <p>"No!" Felix shouted rather than answered, and rushed away
    from the spot like a lunatic.</p>

    <p>Once more at home, he shut out everyone and flung himself on
    his bed, in a state of stupor that weighed him down till
    night&mdash;a sort of dull torpor of brain, with utter
    exhaustion of physical strength&mdash;a misery of formless
    thought. Towards evening one persistent idea aroused him from
    this strange lethargy.</p>

    <p>"I am a cowardly murderer," he groaned. "I wished for my
    fellow-being's death. God punishes me&mdash;I will execute his
    sentence." He stretched out his hand in the dark, groping for a
    dagger that hung from the wall. Then a mild brightness filtered
    through the curtains and irradiated the bed. Felix distinctly
    saw the grotesque figure of Mandarin Li standing a few steps
    away. The shadow of death darkened his face, and without
    seeming movement of his lips, Felix heard these words, uttered
    by that shrill ringing voice so hated, now mellowed into divine
    music.</p>

    <p>"Felix d'Aubremel, God does not will that you should die,
    and I, his servant, am sent to tell you his decree. You have
    been cruel and covetous&mdash;you have wished an innocent man's
    death, and his death caused that of a multitude of victims to
    the barbarous passions of a great western nation. Man's life
    must be sacred for every man. God only can take what he gave.
    Live, then, if you would not add a great crime to a great
    error. And if forgiveness from one dead can restore in part
    your strength and courage to endure, Felix, I forgive you."</p>

    <p>The vision vanished.</p>

    <p>Felix religiously obeyed the instructions of Li, and
    consecrated his life by a vow to the relief of human misery
    wherever he found it. He devoted Richard Malden's vast fortune
    to founding charitable establishments. Ernestine Montmorot
    would never consent to see him again.</p>

    <p>Two years ago, yielding to an impulse easy to understand, he
    requested the English consul at Chiusang to make inquiries as
    to the family of Li, who might perhaps be suffering in poverty.
    Nothing more could be discovered than that the gracious
    sovereign of the Middle Kingdom had confiscated the property of
    Li's family, that his wife had died of sorrow, in misery, and
    that his son, Li, having taken the liberty to complain of the
    glorious emperor's severity, suffered death by the bowstring,
    as is proper and reasonable in all well-governed states.</p>

    <p>"Belle et douce Marguerite, aimable soeur du roi Kingcup,"
    enthusiastically exclaims genial Leigh Hunt, "we would tilt for
    thee with a hundred pens against the stoutest poet that did not
    find perfection in thy cheek." And yet, who would have the
    heart to slander the daisy, or cause a blush of shame to tint
    its whiteness? Tastes vary, and poets may value the flower
    differently; but a rash, deliberate condemnation of the daisy
    is as likely to become realized as is a harsh condemnation of
    the innocence and simplicity of childhood. So the chivalric
    Hunt need not fear being invoked from the silence of the grave
    to take part in a lively tournament for "belle et douce
    Marguerite."</p>

    <p>Subjectively, the daisy is a theme upon which we love to
    linger. In our natural state, when flesh and spirit are both
    models of meekness, two objects are wont to throw us into a
    kind of ecstasy: a row of nicely painted white railings, and a
    bunch of fresh daisies. These waft us back along a vista of
    years, peopled with scenes the most entrancing, and fancies the
    most pleasing. They call up at once the old country home: the
    honeysuckle clasping the thatched cottage, contrasting so
    prettily with the white fence in front: the sloping fields of
    green painted with daisies, through which, unshackled, the
    buoyant breeze swept so peacefully. It was an invariable rule,
    in those days, to troop through the meadows at early morn and,
    like a young knight-errant, bear home in triumph "Marguerite,"
    the peerless daisy, rescued from the clutches of unmentionable
    dragons, and now to beam brightly on us for the rest of the day
    from a neighboring mantel-piece. And it was with great
    reluctance that we refrained from decapitating the whole field
    of daisies at one fell sweep, when we were once allowed to
    touch their upturned faces. A contract was then made on the
    spot: we were permitted to pluck the daisies on condition that
    we plucked but one every day. The field was not large, and long
    before the blasts of autumn had hushed the voices of the
    flowers, not a single daisy remained. Advancing spring threw
    lavish handfuls once more on the grass, and on these we sported
    anew with all the ardor of boyhood.</p>

    <p>Our enthusiasm for the daisy then is only equaled by the
    gratitude it now awakens. Too soon does the busy world, with
    unwarrantable liberty, allure us from boyish scenes. Too soon
    are the buoyant fancies of youth succeeded by the feverish
    anxieties of age, happy innocence by the consciousness of evil,
    confidence by doubt, faith by despair. We must chill our
    demonstrativeness, restrain our affections, blunt our
    sensibilities. We must cultivate conscience until we have too
    much of it, and become monkish, savage and misanthropic. The
    asceticism of manhood is apparent from the studied air with
    which everybody is on his guard against his neighbor. In a
    crowded car, men instinctively clutch their pockets, and fancy
    a pickpocket in a benevolent-looking old gentleman opposite.
    When we see men so distrustful, we shun them. They then call us
    selfish when we feel only solitary. We protest against such
    manhood as would lower golden ideals of youth to its own
    contemptible <i>Avernus</i>. And now as our daisy, which is
    blooming before us, sagely nods its white crest as it is swayed
    by the passing breeze, it seems to bring back of itself decades
    gone forever. We never intend to become a man. We keep our
    boy's heart ever fresh and ever warm. We don't care if the
    whole human race, from the Ascidians to Darwin himself, assail
    us and fiercely thrust us once more into short jackets and
    knickerbockers, provided they allow an indefinite vacation in a
    daisy field. The joy of childhood is said to be vague. It was
    all satisfying to us once, and we do not intend to allow it to
    waste in unconscious effervescence among the gaudier though
    less gratifying delights of manhood.</p>

    <p>It is, however, of daisies among the poets we would speak at
    more length. In fact, to the imaginative mind, the daisy in
    poetry is as suggestive as the daisy in nature.
    Philosophically, they are identical; in the absence of the one
    you can commune with the other. Thus unconsciously the daisy
    undergoes a metempsychosis; its soul is transferred at will
    from meadow to book and from book to meadow, without losing a
    particle of its vitality.</p>

    <p>To premise with the daisy historically: Among the Romans it
    was called <i>Bellis</i>, or "pretty one;" in modern Greece, it
    is star-flower. In France, Spain, and Italy, it was named
    "Marguerita," or pearl, a term which, being of Greek origin,
    doubtless was brought from Constantinople by the Franks. From
    the word "Marguerita," poems in praise of the daisy were termed
    "Bargerets." Warton calls them "Bergerets," or "songs du
    Berger," that is, shepherd songs. These were pastorals, lauding
    fair mistresses and maidens of the day under the familiar title
    of the daisy. Froissart has written a characteristic Bargeret;
    and Chaucer, in his "Flower and the Leaf," sings:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"And, at the last, there began, anone,</p>

            <p>A lady for to sing right womanly,</p>

            <p>A bargaret in praising the daisie;</p>

            <p>For as methought among her notes sweet,</p>

            <p>She said, 'Si douce est la Margarite."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Speght supposes that Chaucer here intends to pay a
    compliment to Lady Margaret, King Edward's daughter, Countess
    of Pembroke, one of his patronesses. But Warton hesitates to
    express a decided opinion as to the reference. Chaucer shows
    his love for the daisy in other places. In his "Prologue to the
    Legend of Good Women," alluding to the power with which the
    flowers drive him from his books, he says that</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i10">"all the floures in the mede,</p>

            <p>Than love I most these floures white and rede,</p>

            <p>Soch that men callen daisies in our toun</p>

            <p>To hem I have so great affectioun,</p>

            <p>As I sayd erst, whan comen is the May,</p>

            <p>That in my bedde there daweth me no day,</p>

            <p>That I nam up and walking in the mede,</p>

            <p>To seen this floure agenst the Sunne sprede."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>To see it early in the morn, the poet continues:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"That blissfull sight softeneth all my sorow,</p>

            <p>So glad am I, whan that I have presence</p>

            <p>Of it, to done it all reverence</p>

            <p>As she that is of all floures the floure."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Chaucer says that to him it is ever fresh, that he will
    cherish it till his heart dies; and then he describes himself
    resting on the grass, gazing on the daisy:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Adowne full softly I gan to sink,</p>

            <p>And leaning on my elbow and my side,</p>

            <p>The long day I shope me for to abide,</p>

            <p>For nothing els, and I shall nat lie,</p>

            <p>But for to looke upon the daisie,</p>

            <p>That well by reason men it call may</p>

            <p>The daisie, or els the eye of day."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Chaucer gives us the true etymology of the word in the last
    line. Ben Jonson, to confirm it, writes with more force than
    elegance,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Days-eyes, and the lippes of cows;"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>that is, cowslips; a "disentanglement of
    compounds,"&mdash;Leigh Hunt says, in the style of the
    parodists:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Puddings of the plum</p>

            <p>And fingers of the lady."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The poets abound in allusions to the daisy. It serves both
    for a moral and for an epithet. The morality is adduced more by
    our later poets, who have written whole poems in its honor. The
    earlier poets content themselves generally with the daisy in
    description, and leave the daisy in ethics to such a
    philosophico-poetical Titan as Wordsworth. Douglas (1471), in
    his description of the month of May, writes:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The dasy did on crede (unbraid) hir crownet
            smale."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And Lyndesay (1496), in the prologue to his "Dreme,"
    describes June</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Weill bordowrit with dasyis of delyte."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The eccentric Skelton, who wrote about the close of the 15th
    century, in a sonnet, says:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Your colowre</p>

            <p>Is lyke the daisy flowre</p>

            <p>After the April showre."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Thomas Westwood, in an agreeable little madrigal, pictures
    the daisies:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"All their white and pinky faces</p>

            <p>Starring over the green places."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Thomas Nash (1592), in another of similar quality,
    exclaims:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The fields breathe sweet,</p>

            <p>The daisies kiss our feet."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Suckling, in his famous "Wedding," in his description of the
    bride, confesses:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Her cheeks so rare a white was on</p>

            <p>No daisy makes comparison."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Spenser, in his "Prothalamion," alludes to</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The little dazie that at evening closes."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>George Wither speaks of the power of his imagination:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"By a daisy, whose leaves spread</p>

            <p>Shut when Titan goes to bed;</p>

            <p>Or a shady bush or tree,</p>

            <p>She could more infuse in me</p>

            <p>Than all Nature's beauties can</p>

            <p>In some other wiser man."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Poor Chatterton, in his "Tragedy of Ella," refers to the
    daisy in the line:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"In daiseyed mantells is the mountayne dyghte."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Hervey, in his "May," describes</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The daisy singing in the grass</p>

            <p>As thro' the cloud the star."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And Hood, in his fanciful "Midsummer Fairies," sings of</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Daisy stars whose firmament is green."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Burns, whose "Ode to a Mountain Daisy" is so universally
    admired, gives, besides, a few brief notices of the daisy:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The lowly daisy sweetly blows&mdash;"</p>

            <p>"The daisy's for simplicity and unaffected air."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Tennyson has made the daisy a subject of one of his most
    unsatisfactory poems. In "Maud," he writes:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Her feet have touched the meadows</p>

            <p>And left the daisies rosy."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>To Wordsworth, the poet of nature, the daisy seems perfectly
    intelligible. Scattered throughout the lowly places, with
    meekness it seems to shed beauty over its surroundings, and
    compensate for gaudy vesture by cheerful contentment.
    Wordsworth calls the daisy "the poet's darling," "a nun
    demure," "a little Cyclops," "an unassuming commonplace of
    nature," and sums up its excellences in a verse which may fitly
    conclude our attempt to pluck a bouquet of fresh daisies from
    the poets:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Sweet flower! for by that name at last,</p>

            <p>When all my reveries are past,</p>

            <p>I call thee, and to that cleave fast;</p>

            <p class="i2">Sweet silent creature!</p>

            <p>That breath'st with me in sun and air,</p>

            <p>Do thou, as thou art wont, repair</p>

            <p>My heart with gladness, and a share</p>

            <p class="i2">Of thy meek nature!"</p>

    <p>"This," says Mr. Bayard Taylor, in the <i>Notes</i> to his

    of Germany. Herder published it in his <i>Volkslieder</i>, in
    1779, but it was no doubt familiar to Goethe in his childhood.
    The original melody, to which it is still sung, is as simple
    and sweet as the
    words."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224"

    <h2><i>AMONG THE PERUVIANS.</i></h2>

    <p>The extremes of civilization and barbarism are nearer
    together in those countries which the Spaniards have wrested
    from their native inhabitants, than in any other portion of the
    globe. Before other European races, aboriginal tribes, even the
    fiercest, gradually disappear. They hold their own before the
    descendants of the <i>conquistadores</i>, who conquered the New
    World only to be conquered by it. Out of Spain the Spaniard
    deteriorates, and nowhere so much as in South America. Of
    course he is superior there to the best of the Indian tribes
    with which he is thrown in contact; but we doubt whether he is
    superior to the intelligent, but forgotten, races which peopled
    the regions around him centuries before Pizzaro set foot
    therein, and which built enormous cities whose ruins have long
    been overgrown by forests. To compare the Spaniard of to-day,
    in Peru, with its ancient Incas is to do him no honor. To be
    sure, he is a good Catholic, which the Incas were not, but he
    is indolent, enervated, and enslaved by his own passions. His
    religion has not done much for him&mdash;at least in this
    world, whatever it may do in the next. It has done still less,
    if that be possible, for the aboriginal Peruvians.</p>

    <p>"In all parts of Peru," says a recent traveler, "except
    amongst the savage Indian tribes, Christianity, at least
    nominally prevails. The aborigines, however, converted by the
    sword in the old days of Spanish persecution, do not, as a
    rule, seem to have more notion of that faith in the country
    parts, than such as may be obtained from stray visits of some
    errant, image-bearing friar, whose principal object is to
    obtain sundry <i>reals</i> in consideration of prayers offered
    to his little idols. These wandering ministers also distribute
    execrably colored prints of various saints, besides having
    indulgences for sale. As to the nature of the pious offerings
    from their disciples, they are not at all particular. They go
    upon the easy principle that all is fish that comes into their
    net. If the ignorant and superstitious givers have not 'filthy
    lucre' wherewithal to propitiate the ugly represented saints,
    wax candles, silver ore, cacao, sugar, and any other
    description of property is as readily received. Thus, it often
    happens that these peripatetic friars have a long convoy of
    heavily-laden mules with which to gladden the members of their
    monastery when they return home.</p>

    <p>"The priests in all parts of Peru dress in a very
    extraordinary, not to say outlandish manner. One of the lower
    grade wears a very capacious shovel hat, projecting as much in
    front as behind, and looking very like a double-ended
    coal-heaver's <i>hat</i>. A loose black serge robe covers him
    all over, as with a funereal pall, and being fastened together
    only at the neck, gives to his often obese figure an appearance
    the very reverse of grave or serious: The superior of a
    monastery, or the priest in charge of a parish, wears a more
    stately clerical costume. His hat is of formidable
    dimensions&mdash;a huge, flat, Chinese-umbrella-shaped sort of
    a concern, which cannot be compared to anything else in
    creation. He also affects ruffles and lace, a long cassock, and
    a voluminous cloak like many of those of Geneva combined
    together; black silk stockings and low shoes complete the
    clerical array of the higher ecclesiastics."</p>

    <p>Quite as odd, in their way, as these good padres, are the
    Peruvian loungers, the "lions" of Lima&mdash;a long-haired,
    becloaked, truculent-looking set of fellows, whose proper place
    would seem to be among operatic banditti. A greater contrast
    and disparity than exists between them and the beautiful
    brunettes to whom they are fain to devote themselves, cannot
    well be imagined. That the latter generally prefer European
    gentlemen to these ill-favored beaux, follows as a matter of
    course. That the discarded "lion" resents this preference of
    his fair countrywomen, we have the testimony of the traveler
    already quoted from.</p>

    <p>"Instinctively, as it were, a feeling of dislike and rivalry
    seemed to prevail between ourselves and such of these truculent
    gentry as it was our fortune to come into contact with. They
    were jealous, no doubt, of the wandering foreigners, whom they
    chose contemptuously to term <i>gringos</i>, but who, they know
    well enough, are infinitely preferred to themselves by their
    handsome coquettish countrywomen. It is, indeed, notoriously
    the fact, that any respectable man of European birth can marry
    well, and even far above his own social position, amongst the
    dark-eyed donnas of Peru. The men don't seem exactly to like
    it. Judging by their appearance, we found but little difficulty
    in believing the character which report had given
    them&mdash;namely, their proneness to assassination, especially
    in love affairs, either personally, or, more frequently, by
    deputy. If the brilliant creole and half-caste women of this
    warm, tropical country, are some of the most beautiful and
    lovable of the sex, their sallow, sinister-looking, natural
    protectors are just the very opposite. The singular difference
    in the moral and physical characteristics of the two sexes is
    something really remarkable, and I, for one, cannot
    satisfactorily explain it to my own mind. That such is the case
    I venture to affirm; the why and the wherefore I must fain
    leave to wiser ethnological heads."</p>

    <p>Not less curious, as regards costume, are the Peruvian
    ladies. And, as they are <i>equestriennes</i>, we will describe
    their riding-habits in the words of the same traveler:</p>

    <p>"To commence at the top. This riding dress consisted of a
    huge felt hat, both tall and broad, and generally ornamented
    with a plume of three great feathers sticking up in front. Next
    came an all-round sort of a cape, of no shape in particular,
    with a wide collar, several rows of fringe, much needle-work
    (and corresponding waste of time upon so hideous a garment),
    and of a length sufficient to reach below the waist, and so
    completely hide and spoil the wearer's generally fine figure.
    Then came a short overskirt, extending a little below the
    knees, and beneath which appeared the fair senora or senorita's
    most unfeminine pantaloons, which, being carefully tied above
    the ankle in a frill, were allowed to fully display that
    treasure of treasures, that most valued of charms, the
    beautiful little foot and ankle. In addition to this absurd
    dress, which conceals the graceful form of perhaps the
    handsomest race of women in the world, the fair creatures have
    a style of riding which, to Europeans accustomed to the
    side-saddle, certainly seems more
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span> peculiar than elegant; that
       is to say, they ride &aacute; la Duchesse de
       Berri&mdash;<i>Anglic&egrave;</i>, like a man.</p>

    <p>"The full dress, or evening costume, in the provinces,
    seemed simply an exaggeration upon that of the towns&mdash;the
    crinoline being more extensive, the petticoats shorter, and the
    dressing of the hair still more wonderful and elaborate."</p>

    <p>Among the <i>mestizos</i>, half-castes, of white and Indian
    origin the women are often very beautiful, especially when the
    blood of the latter prevails. They are, we are told, the
    best-looking of all the Peruvian women, possessing brilliantly
    fair complexions, magnificent long black tresses, lithe and
    graceful figures of exquisite proportions, regular and classic
    features, and the most superb great black eyes.</p>

    <p>"Though often glorious in youth, these dark-skinned,
    passionate daughters of the sunny Pacific shore soon begin to
    fade. Although their scant costume and the <i>manto y
    saya</i>&mdash;the dress favored at night&mdash;serve only to
    expose and display the charming contour of their youthful form,
    as the years roll on and rob them of these alluring
    attractions, the simple array becomes ugly and ridiculous.
    Often did we laugh at the absurd figure presented by some
    stout, middle-aged half-caste, or a good many more caste, lady,
    clad in her <i>manto y saya</i>. Especially ludicrous did these
    staid females appear when viewed from behind."</p>

    <p>The Peruvian negress, of elderly years, compares not
    unfavorably with her whiter Spanish sister of the same age.
    Both display inordinate vanity, which consorts ill with the
    brawny calves and large feet they cannot help showing on
    account of their short though voluminous skirts, and both have
    a womanly love of jewelry.</p>

    <p>"They manifest a very apparent weakness for all sorts of
    glittering ornaments, especially in the way of numerous rings,
    huge ear-rings, and mighty necklaces. Indeed, it is not at all
    uncommon to see pearls (their favorite gem) of great value,
    rising and falling, and gleaming with incongruous lustre, upon
    their bare, black, and massive bosoms; whilst ear-rings of
    solid gold hang glittering from their large ears, in singular
    contrast to their common and dirty clothing.</p>

    <p>"Except for the occasional excitement of theatre,
    cock-fight, or bull-fight, and the regular attendance at mass
    and vespers, the life of the higher class Limena is a dreamy
    existence of languor, amidst siestas, cigarettes, agua-rica,
    and jasmine perfumes, the tinkling of guitars, and the melody
    of song. Alas! that I must record it; she is, too, a terrible
    <i>intriguante</i>. The <i>manto y saya</i>, the <i>b&ecirc;te
    noir</i> of many a poor jealous husband, seems a garment for
    disguise, invented on purpose to oblige her. It is the very
    thing for an intriguing dame; and, by a stringent custom, bears
    a sacred inviolate right, for no man dare profane it by a
    touch, although he may even suspect the bright black eye, it
    may alone allow to be seen, to be that of his own wife! He can
    follow, if he likes, the graceful, muffled up figure that he
    dreads to be so familiar, but woe to the wretch who dares to
    pull aside a fair Limena's <i>manto</i>! If seen, he would
    surely experience the resentment of the crowd, and become a
    regular laughing-stock to all who knew him."</p>

    <p>But let us be just to the women of Peru, who, in the matter
    of flirting and fondness for finery, are probably not worse
    than the sex elsewhere. They love where they love with a fervor
    unknown to the women of Europe, their Spanish sisters, perhaps,
    excepted, and they are capable of profound patriotism.</p>

    <p>There is an element of real strength in the wild, stormy
    nature of these beautiful and impassioned creatures: it is
    their misfortune not to know how to hide their weaknesses as
    well as their more sophisticated sisters. The tide of time
    flows so smoothly with them, through such level summer
    landscapes steeped in tropical repose, that the desire for
    excitement naturally arises, and excitement itself becomes a
    necessity. Lacking many of the indoor employments of the women
    of colder climates, time hangs heavy on their hands, idleness
    wearies, and they cast about for a way in which to amuse,
    enjoy, and distract themselves. They find it in love. If no
    European is near upon whom they can bestow their smiles and the
    lustre of their magnificent eyes, they have to be content with
    their own countrymen, who woo them after the fashion of their
    Spanish ancestors, by serenades at night, in which the
    strumming of guitars generally plays a more important part than
    the words it accompanies.</p>

    <p>While we are among the Peruvians, we must not entirely
    overlook their country, and the features of its varied
    landscapes. It is divided by the Andes into three different
    lands, so to speak, <i>La Costa</i>, the region between the
    coast and the Andes; <i>La Sierra</i>, the mountain region, and
    <i>La Monta&ntilde;a</i>, or the wooded region east of the
    Andes. <i>La Costa</i>, in which Lima is situated, at the
    distance of about six miles from the sea, may be briefly
    described as a sandy desert, interspersed with fertile valleys,
    and watered by several rivers of no great magnitude. It seldom
    or never rains there, but there are heavy dews at night which
    freshen and preserve the vegetation. The magnificence of the
    mountain region baffles all attempts at word-painting, as it
    baffles the art of the painter. Church, the artist, gives us
    what is, perhaps, the best representation we are ever likely to
    have of it, but it is only a glimpse after all. Still more
    indescribable, if that be possible, are the enormous
    wildernesses which stretch from the Andes to the vast pampas to
    the eastward. "Here everything is on Nature's great scale. The
    whole country is one continuous forest, which, beginning at
    very different heights, presents an undulating aspect. One
    moves on his way with trees before, above, and beneath him, in
    a deep abyss like the ocean. And in these woods, as on the
    immensity of the waters, the mind is bewildered; whatever way
    it directs the eye there it meets the majesty of the Infinite.
    The marvels of Nature are in these regions so common that one
    becomes accustomed to behold, without emotion, trees whose tops
    exceed the height of 100 varas (290 English feet), with a
    proportionate thickness, beyond the belief of such as never saw
    them; and, supporting on their trunks a hundred different
    plants, they, individually, present rather the appearance of a
    small plantation than one great tree. It is only after you
    leave the woods, and ordinary objects of comparison present
    themselves to the mind, that you can realize in thought the
    colossal stature of these samples of Montana vegetation."</p>

    <p>Peru is a fitting theatre for the great dramas which have
    been played upon its wild, mountainous stage. The dark
    background of its past is haunted by the shadows of the unknown
    race who built its ruined cities and temples. Then come the
    beneficent, heavenly Incas, and the mild, pastoral people over
    whom they rule. Last, the cruel, treacherous Spaniard,
    slaughtering his friendly hosts with one hand, while the other
    holds the Bible to their
    lips!</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"

    <h2><a name="old_maids"
       id="old_maids"><i>THE OLD MAID'S VILLAGE.</i></a></h2>

    <p>I had been passing the summer on the banks of the
    Hudson&mdash;in that charmed region which lies about what was
    once the home of Diedrich Knickerbocker, with the enchanted
    ground of Sleepy Hollow on the one hand, and the shrine of
    Sunnyside on the other. In many happy morning walks and
    peaceful twilight rambles, I had made the acquaintance of every
    winding lane, every shaded avenue, every bosky dell and sunny
    glade for miles around. I had wandered hither and thither,
    through all the golden season, and fairly steeped my soul in
    the beauty, the languor, the poetry of the "Irving country;"
    and now, filled, as it were, with rare wine, content and happy,
    I was ready to return to the town, and take up the
    matter-of-fact habit of life again.</p>

    <p>But even on the last day of my sojourn, when my trunks stood
    packed and corded, and the loins of my spirit were girt for
    departure on the morrow; as I stood at my window somewhat
    pensively contemplating, for the last time, the peculiarly
    delicious river-bit which it framed, the door opened suddenly,
    and Nannette, my <i>fidus Achates</i>, and the companion of my
    summer, ran in.</p>

    <p>"Do you know," she cried, "I have just learned that we were
    about to leave the place without visiting one of its greatest
    curiosities? We have narrowly escaped going without having seen
    the 'Old Maid's Village!'"</p>

    <p>"The 'Old Maid's Village!'" I echoed, stupidly. "But what
    village is <i>not</i> the peculiar property of the race?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I know; but this village is really built on an old
    maid's property, and by her own hands. And there is the 'Cat's
    Monument,' too. Come! don't stop to talk about it, but let us
    go and see it. It will be just the thing for a last evening; in
    memoriam, you know, and all that. Get on your hat, and come,
    and we shall see the sunset meeting the moonrise on the river
    once more, as we return."</p>

    <p>That, at least, was always worth seeing, I reflected; and
    so, without more ado, I put on my wraps as I was bid, and
    reported myself under marching orders.</p>

    <p>How lovely, how indescribably lovely, the world was that
    September afternoon, as we strolled along the shaded sidewalk
    where the maples were already laying a mosaic of gold and
    garnet, and looked off toward the river and the hills
    beyond&mdash;the far blue hills&mdash;all veiled in tenderest
    amber mist! The very air was full of soft, warm color; the
    sunbeams, mild and level now, played with the shadows across
    our path, and every now and then a leaf, flecked with orange or
    crimson, fluttered to our feet. The blue-birds sang in the
    goldening boughs, unaffrighted by the constant roll of elegant
    equipages in which, at this hour, the residents of the stately
    mansions on either side the road were taking the air; and the
    crickets hopped about undisturbed in the crevices of the gray
    stone walls.</p>

    <p>We walked leisurely on, past one and another lofty gateway,
    until presently reaching an entrance rather less assuming than
    its neighbors, but, like them, hospitably open, Nannette said,
    with promptness:</p>

    <p>"This is the place, I am sure. Square white house; black
    railing; next to the printing-press man's great gate. Come
    right in; all are welcome, and not even thank you to pay, for
    one never sees anyone to speak to here."</p>

    <p>It seemed to my modesty rather an audacious proceeding, but
    trusting to my companion's superior information, I followed her
    in, and we walked up a circular carriage-drive through smooth
    shaven lawns dotted with brilliant clumps of salvia and
    gladiolus, towards the house&mdash;a square, solid structure,
    white, and with broad verandas running across its front.</p>

    <p>At its northern side, sloping towards the wall, was visible
    what looked like an ordinary terrace, rather low, and
    ornamented with small shrubs and grotto-work; but which, on
    nearer approach, proved to be a veritable village in miniature,
    constructed with a verisimilitude of design, and a fidelity to
    detail, which was at once in the highest degree amazing and
    amusing. As Nannette had been assured, no one appeared to
    interfere with us in any way, and full of a curious wonder at
    such a manifestation of eccentric ingenuity, we seated
    ourselves upon a wooden box, evidently kept more for the
    purpose of protecting the odd out-of-door plaything in bad
    weather, and proceeded to give it the minute inspection which
    it merited; the result of which I chronicle here for the
    benefit of the like curious minded.</p>

    <p>The terrace, which forms the site of this doll-baby city, is
    low and semi-circular in shape, and separated from the graveled
    drive by a close border of box. Within this protecting hedge
    the ground is laid out in the most picturesque and fantastic
    manner compatible with a scale of extreme minuteness. Winding
    roads, shady bye-paths ending in rustic stiles, willow-bordered
    ponds, streams with fairy bridges, rocky ravines and sunny
    meadows, ferny dells, and steep hills clambered over with a
    wilderness of tangled vines, and strewn with lichen-covered
    stones&mdash;all are there, and all reproduced with the most
    conscientious fidelity to nature, and with Lilliputian
    diminutiveness. Regular streets, "macadamized" with a gray
    cement which gives very much the effect of asphaltum, separate
    one demesne from another; and each meadow, lawn, field, and
    barn-yard has its own proper fence or wall, constructed in the
    most workmanlike manner. The streets are bordered by trees,
    principally evergreens, which, though rigidly kept down to the
    height of mere shrubs, appear stately by the side of the
    miniature mansions they overlook; and, in every dooryard, or
    more pretentious greensward, tiny larches, pines yet in their
    babyhood, and dwarfed cedars, cast a mimic shade, and bestow an
    air of dignity and venerableness to the place.</p>

    <p>The first object upon which the eye is apt to rest on
    approaching this modern Lilliput is the squire's house, the
    residence of the landed proprietor. This is a handsome edifice
    of some eight by ten inches in breadth and height. It stands
    upon an eminence in the midst of ornamented grounds, and with
    its white walls, its lofty cupola, and high, square portico,
    presents a properly imposing appearance. There are signs of
    social life about the mansion befitting its own style of
    conscious superiority. In the wide arched entrance hall stands
    a high-born dame attired in gay Watteau
    costume&mdash;red-heeled slippers, brocaded petticoat, and
    bodice and train of puce-colored satin. She is receiving the
    adieux of an elegant gentleman, hatted, booted, and spurred,
    who, with whip in hand and dog by his side, is about to descend
    the steps and mount his horse for a ride over his estate. A
    bird-cage swings by an open window, and, on the lawn, a group
    of children, in charge of their nurse, are engaged in the
    time-honored game of "Ring-around-a-rosy." Winding walks,
    bordered with shrubbery, disappear among fantastic mounds of
    rock-work, moss-grown grottoes, and tiny dells of fern; and
    under a ruined arch, gray with lichen and green with vines,
    flows a placid streamlet, spanned by a rustic bridge. In the
    meadow beyond, flocks of sheep are cropping the grass, and an
    old negro is busily engaged in repairing a breach in the stone
    wall.</p>

    <p>Hard by this stately demesne is a humbler tenement, built of
    wattled logs, but showing signs of comfort and thrift all about
    it. The old grandsire sits in a high-backed chair, sunning
    himself in front of the door; on a bench, at the side of the
    house, stand rows of washtubs filled with soiled linen, and a
    woman is busy wringing out clothes; while another, with a
    bucket on her head, goes to the well to supply her with a fresh
    thimbleful of water; and still a third milks a handsome
    dapple-gray cow in the yard where the dairy stands. There is a
    well-filled barn behind, with another cow and a horse, too, for
    that matter, in the stable attached, and the farmer, who is
    putting the last sheaf on his wheat-stack, looks contented
    enough with his lot.</p>

    <p>Just beyond the stream, on whose bank the fisherman sits
    leisurely dropping his line, stands the village church; a
    fac-simile of the old Dutch Church which has stood near the
    entrance of Sleepy Hollow since long before the Revolution, and
    is hallowed now not only by the pious associations of
    centuries, but by the near vicinage of Irving's grave. In its
    little twelve-inch counterpart, every point of the ancient
    structure is preserved in exact detail. The dull red walls, the
    beetling roof, the narrow pointed windows and low, arched door;
    the quaint Dutch weathercock, and odd-shaped tower&mdash;aye,
    even the bell within, no bigger than a doll's thimble&mdash;and
    upon all a sentimental traveler in the person of a china figure
    perhaps three inches in height, is gazing half pensively, half
    curiously, as we suppose, at this relic of by-gone years!</p>

    <p>On the other side of the stream the village school, likewise
    an ancient and steeple-crowned edifice, stands out in the midst
    of a bare and clean swept playground. It bears its signature
    upon its front:</p>

    <p>"DISTRICT SCHOOL, NO. 2,"</p>

    <p>and its worshipful character is otherwise indicated by the
    presence of the master, a venerable looking puppet in cocked
    hat and knee-breeches, in the doorway, and sundry china
    children playing rather stiffly about the stone steps.</p>

    <p>Ascending by a steep, rocky path, one arrives at a rather
    pretentious looking wind-mill, which spreads its wide white
    arms protectingly over the cottages below. Barrels of flour and
    sacks of meal, well filled and plentiful in number, attest its
    thriving business, and the miller himself, in a properly dusty
    coat, looks about him with contented air. At the foot of the
    hill upon which the mill is perched, are several
    dwellings&mdash;all showing signs of more or less prosperous
    life, with the exception of one, which affords the orthodox
    "haunted house" belonging to every well-regulated village. The
    ruined walls of this old mansion, with lichen cropping out from
    every crevice; the unhinged doors and broken windows; the
    ladder rotting as it leans against the moss-grown roof, the
    broken well-sweep and deserted barn, offer an aspect of
    desolation and decay which should prove sufficient bait to
    tempt any ghost of moderate demands.</p>

    <p>In direct contrast to the gloom which surrounds this now
    empty and forsaken home, one observes, in a shady grove
    surmounting a ridge of hills which rise somewhat steeply here
    from the roadway, a party of "pic-nickers" gaily attired and
    disporting themselves after the time-honored manner of such
    merry-makers; swinging, dancing, or, better still, strolling
    off arm in arm, in search of cooler shades, and of that company
    which is never a crowd.</p>

    <p>At the base of this rocky ridge, the same stream which one
    meets above flowing darkly under arch and bridge, winds
    placidly along in sunshine and shadow until it loses itself in
    a clump of alders and willows quite at the edge of the
    box-bordered terrace; and here the village ends.</p>

    <p>Not so my sketch: for I have purposely left it to the last
    to make mention of the great central idea round which all the
    rest is gathered, and which, doubtless, formed the germ of the
    whole oddly-conceived, but most admirably-executed plan. This
    is the "Cat's Monument" of which Nannette had made mention, and
    which is a structure so original and imposing that it deserves
    special and minute description.</p>

    <p>About midway the terrace, and conspicuous from its size and
    height, rises a mound of earth shaped into the semblance of an
    urn or vase, crusted thickly with bits of rock, moss, and
    pebbles, and overgrown with a tangle of tiny vines. Surmounting
    this picturesque pedestal is an obelisk of black-veined marble
    on a granite base, the whole rising some seven feet from the
    ground. On the polished surface of this memorial pillar is
    inscribed, in large black capitals, the following classic and
    touching tribute to the venerable departed who sleeps in peace
    below:</p>

    vivo amicorum ardentium memoria?</i></p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>On the reverse side of the column appears an inscription
    even more pathetic and poetic, to yet another departed
    favorite, who seems, not like Tommy to have been gathered to
    his fathers ripe in years and honors but to have been cut down
    in the bloom of youth by some untimely and tragic fate. He is
    all the more felin'ly lamented:</p>

    nimium felix! si litora ista nunquam tetigissem!</i>"</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Thanks to certain by no means homoeopathic doses of the
    Latin grammar in my early years, I was able to gather the
    meaning of these elegiac effusions, and when the last stanza
    embodying poor Pussy's posthumous wail was discovered to be
    none other than the despairing death-cry of the "infelix Dido"
    as immortalized by Virgil&mdash;the one step from the sublime
    to the ridiculous seemed to have been passed.</p>

    <p>I looked at Nannette, and Nannette looked at me, and we
    burst into silent but irrepressible laughter. Nannette was the
    first to recover herself.</p>

    <p>"We ought to be ashamed of ourselves," said she
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
       id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span> severely: "Honest grief is
       always respectable; and a fitting tribute to departed worth,
       no more than what is due from the survivors. I have no doubt
       but that Tommy and Pussy were most esteemed members of
       society, and that their loss has left an aching void in the
       family of which they were the youngest and most petted
       darlings. I have heard the history of this monument, and the
       village that has grown up around it, and if you will comport
       yourself more as a Christian being should in the presence of
       a solemn memorial, I will relate to you the interesting
       facts in my possession."</p>

    <p>I immediately signified a due contrition and full purpose of
    amendment; when Nannette continued, still speaking with the
    gravity befitting the subject.</p>

    <p>"This estate then, this large and respectable mansion, and
    these pleasant grounds in which we now sit, are the property in
    common of three most estimable ladies, all past their first
    youth, and all possessed of sufficient good sense and strength
    of mind to remain their own mistresses, which has procured for
    the very remarkable specimen of ingenuity now before us, from
    some ignorant townspeople, the sobriquet of the 'Old Maid's
    Village.'</p>

    <p>"There is only one of the ladies, however, I am informed,
    who interests herself in the construction of these most
    ingenious toys. Possessed of ample means, and more than ample
    leisure, she amuses herself in hours which might otherwise be
    devoted to gossip and tea, in putting together these various
    models of buildings, all differing in style, and of most
    singular materials. The church, for instance, is built of
    fragments of clinker, gathered from stove and grate, and held
    firmly together by cement. Nothing could have reproduced so
    exactly the rough reddish stone of which the old Sleepy Hollow
    Church is built. The window-glass is represented by carefully
    framed pieces of tin foil; the gray stone of the gate-posts is
    imitated by sand rubbed on wooden pillars with a coating of
    cement. The streets are paved in much the same clever fashion.
    The well, the pond, the stream, are filled with water each day
    by the chatelaine's own careful hands. Many of the mimic
    creatures, human and otherwise, are automata, manufactured to
    order; the others are wooden or china figures selected with
    extreme care as to their fitness for their purpose. So rare and
    so exceedingly pretty are some of these little figures, that
    they have become objects of unlawful desire to certain soulless
    curiosity-mongers, who have rewarded an open and confiding
    hospitality with base attempts at spoliation; and now a person
    is employed to live in the cottage just beyond us, and do
    little else than take care of these unique possessions.</p>

    <p>"No, you need not start. The woman is probably there at her
    post, and surveying our operations from time to time. But we
    have behaved like decent people. We are taking away nothing but
    a remembrance of a singularly interesting hour, and an admiring
    impression of the originality, the ingenuity, the industry, and
    the independence of one of our own sex.</p>

    <p>"Is it not so, my friend? And now, by the length of those
    cedar shadows, it is time for us to rise up and be gone. Else
    the moonlight will have met and parted with the sunset ere we
    reach home."</p>

    <p>There was nothing to be said; the tale had been told, and
    with one last, lingering glance, one parting smile, half
    amused, half touched, I rose, and together we walked home in
    somewhat pensive mood. Was it not our last day in
    Fairyland?&mdash;<i>Kate J. Hill</i>.</p>

    <p>I have heard it asked why we speak of the dead with
    unqualified praise: of the living, always with certain
    reservations. It may be answered, because we have nothing to
    fear from the former, while the latter may stand in our way: so
    impure is our boasted solicitude for the memory of the dead. If
    it were the sacred and earnest feeling we pretend, it would

    <h2><a name="queens"
       id="queens"><i>THE QUEEN'S CLOSET.</i></a></h2>

    <p>Did anybody ever see a fairy in the city? Was a glimpse ever
    caught of Fairyland there? I say <i>No</i>. But I was in the
    country this summer where a great number of mushrooms grew, and
    one day when I was walking in a grassy lane I met a little, old
    queen, who was fanning herself with the leaf of the
    poor-man's-weather-glass; she had taken off her crown, and it
    was lying on the top of a lovely red mushroom. I poked the
    mushroom with my parasol, and instantly felt on my face a faint
    puff of air, and heard a hum no louder than the buzz of an
    angry fly.</p>

    <p>I sat down on the grass, and then my eyes fell on the
    queen.</p>

    <p>"You have let my crown fall in the dirt," she said, tossing
    a wisp of hair from her forehead; "but you great, insensible
    beings are always in mischief when you are in the country. Why
    don't you stay at home, in your brick cages that stand on heaps
    of flat stones? You are watched there all the time by creatures
    with clubs in their leather belts, so you cannot tear and crush
    things to pieces as you do here."</p>

    <p>"Oh, I am so sorry, madam," I answered; "if you knew how
    unhappy I felt this morning when I started on my last walk, you
    would pity me. I must go home at once, and my home is in the
    city&mdash;shut in by houses before and behind it. If I look
    out of the window, I only see a strip of sky above me, where
    neither sun nor moon passes on its journey round the world; and
    below me, only the stone pavement over which goes an endless
    procession of men and women, upon a hundred errands I never
    guess at."</p>

    <p>The queen tapped her head with a white stick like a peeled
    twig, and made such a noise that I examined it, and saw an
    ivory knob, which reminded me of the budding horns of a young
    deer. As if in answer to my thought, she said:</p>

    <p>"It drops off every year. In the fairy-nature all elements
    are united. We partake of the animal and vegetable kingdoms,
    and add our own; this makes us what we are. We do not suffer,
    but we experience, without suffering, of course; our long lives
    glide along like dreams. As you are in sleep, so are we awake.
    If you love the country, which contains our kingdom, as the
    filbert-shell contains the kernel, I will endow you with power.
    I will give you something to take back with you."</p>

    <p>What do you think she gave me? A little closet with shelves;
    on each shelf were laid away all my remembrances of the summer,
    for me to unfold at leisure. When she gave me the key, which
    looked exactly like a steel pen, she said: "When you turn the
    key you will understand my power. All things will be alive,
    will know as much, and talk as fast as you do. The closet, in
    short, is but a wee corner of my kingdom, where to-day and
    to-morrow are the same&mdash;past and present one. A
    maid-of-honor wishes to go to town. I'll send her in the
    closet. My slave, the geometrical spider, must spin her a warm
    cobweb&mdash;and when you open the closet, be sure and not
    disturb my little Fancie."</p>

    <p>Some way Queen Imagin disappeared then. To any person less
    knowing than myself, it would have seemed as if a dandelion
    ball was floating in the air; but I knew better, and I watched
    her sailing, sailing away till lost behind the trees. The crown
    was gone, too; I discovered nothing in the neighborhood of the
    red mushroom, except a tiny yellow blossom already wilted by
    the heat of the sun.</p>

    <p>Well, I am at home. I sit down this misty autumn morning in
    my lonely room, and wish for some work or if not that, for
    something to play with. I am too old for dolls, but very young
    in the way of amusement. Ah&mdash;the closet! I'll unlock that;
    the key is at hand&mdash;in my writing-desk.</p>

    <p>Open Sesame! On the top shelf sits little Fancie, her eyes
    shining like diamonds in her soft, dusky cobweb. She nods, so
    do I, and we are in Greenside again&mdash;on a summer evening.
    How the crickets sing; and the tree-toads harp in the trees as
    if they were a picket guard entirely surrounding us. Hueston's
    big dog barks in the lane at just the right distance. What
    security I used to feel when I was a little child, tucked away
    in my bed, and heard a dog bark a mile away; too far off ever
    to come up and bite, and yet near enough to frighten prowling
    robbers!</p>

    <p>"When in the breeze the distant watch-dog bayed," I was
    about to say; but Polly, who is at Greenside with me, calls,
    "Just hear the mosquitoes."</p>

    <p>The blinds must be closed. What a delicious smell comes in!
    The dew wetting all the shrubs and flowers distils sweet odors.
    What a family of moths have rushed in; this big, brown one,
    with white and red markings, is very enterprising. He has
    voyaged twice down the lamp chimney, as if it were the funnel
    of a steamship.</p>

    <p>Get out, moth!</p>

    <p>"Sho," she answers in a husky voice, as if very dry, "It is
    my nature to; that's all you know, turning us to moral
    purposes, and making us a tiresome metaphor. We are much like
    you human creatures&mdash;only we don't compare ourselves
    continually with others. We just scorch ourselves as we please.
    My cousin, Noctilia Glow-worm, who is out late o' nights on the
    grass-bank in poor company&mdash;the Katydids, who board for
    the season with the widow Poplar&mdash;a two-sided, deceitful
    woman&mdash;she does not care where I go, and never shrieks
    out, 'A burnt moth dreads the lamp chimney.' If she sees me
    wingless, she coughs, and throws out a green light, but says
    nothing. Don't mind me; there's more coming."</p>

    <p>It can't be moths making such a noise on the second shelf.
    It is Tom, who calls out to us, from his room, to come, and
    help him catch a bat.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Now air is hushed, save where the weak-eyed bat</p>

            <p>With short shrill shriek flits by on leathern
            wings."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"Always mouthing something," somebody mutters. But we rush
    into Tom's room, and behold him in the middle of the floor,
    flopping north and south, east and west, with a towel. No bat
    is to be seen. I hear a pretty singing, however, and declare it
    to be from a young swallow fallen down the chimney; but as
    there is no fire-place in the room, my opinion goes for
    nothing. Tom maintains that it is a bat; that it flew in by the
    window; and that it is behind the bureau. He is right, for the
    bat whirrs up to the ceiling and from that height accosts us in
    a squeaking voice:</p>

    <p>"I am weak-eyed, am I? and my wings are leathery? Catch me,
    and you will find my wings are like down, my eyes as bright as
    diamonds. How much you know, writing yourselves down in books
    as Naturalists! My name is Vespertila; my family are from
    Servia, at your service. Could you offer me a fly, or a beetle?
    I was chasing Judge Blue Bottle, or I should not have been
    trapped. Go to sleep, dears, and leave me to fan you. When you
    are asleep, I'll bite a hole in your ear, and sup bountifully
    on your red blood."</p>

    <p>Flop went our towels, and down went Miss Vespertila behind
    the bed crying. Polly crept up to her; and caught her in a
    towel. What black beads of eyes had Miss Vespertila from
    Servia, where her grandfather, General Vampire, still commands
    a brigade of rascals! Her teeth were sharp, and white as
    pearls. Polly held her up, and she cunningly combed her furry
    wings with her hind feet, and said:</p>

    <p>"Polly, dear, I itch dreadfully; do you mind plain speaking?
    I am full of bat lice. Ariel caught them, and the folks say
    that Queen Mab often buys fine combs&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Slanderer!" cried Polly, "fly to your witch home!"</p>

    <p>She shook the towel out of the window, and the bat soared
    away.</p>

    <p>"What's coming next?" we all asked. "There are the rabbits
    to hear from, the pigeons, the sparrows, the mole, and the
    striped snake who lives by the garden gate?"</p>

    <p>Slap, Bang! Fancie has pulled the door to. The cunning Queen
    Imagin placed her in the closet, perhaps for this purpose. But
    I have the key. I shall unlock it to-morrow, for I must have
    the picnic over again, under the beech tree, where the brown
    thrush built her nest, and reared her young ones, who ate our
    crumbs, and chirped merrily when we laughed.&mdash;<i>Lolly

    <p>Doth a man reproach thee for being proud or ill-natured,
    envious or conceited, ignorant or detractive, consider with
    thyself whether his reproaches be true. If they are not,
    consider that thou art not the person whom he reproaches, but
    that he reviles an imaginary being, and perhaps loves what thou
    really art, although he hates what thou appearest to be. If his
    reproaches are true, if thou art the envious, ill-natured man
    he takes thee for, give thyself another turn, become mild,
    affable and obliging, and his reproaches of thee naturally

    <h2><a name="literature"
       id="literature"><i>LITERATURE.</i></a></h2>

    <p>"Of the making of many books there is no end," said the Wise
    Man of old. Of the making of good books there is frequently an
    end, say we. The good books of one year may be counted on the
    fingers of one hand. Among those of the present year none ranks
    higher than Taine's "Art in Greece," a translation of which, by
    Mr. John Durand, is published by Messrs. Holt &amp; Williams.
    The French are a nation of critics, and Taine is the critic of
    the French. This could not have been said with truth during the
    lifetime of Sainte-Beuve, but since his death it is true. There
    is nothing, apparently, which Taine is not competent to
    criticise, so subtle is his intellect, and so wide the range of
    his studies, but what he is most competent to criticise is Art.
    We have heard great things of a History of English Literature
    by him, but as it has not yet appeared in an English dress
    (although Messrs. Holt &amp; Williams have a translation of it
    in press) we shall reserve our decision until it appears. Art,
    it seems to us, is the specialty to which Taine has devoted
    himself, with the enthusiasm peculiar to his countrymen, and a
    thoroughness peculiar to himself. Others may have accumulated
    greater stores of art-knowledge&mdash;the knowledge
    indispensable to the historian of Art, and the biographer of
    artists&mdash;but none has so saturated himself with the spirit
    of Art as Taine. We may not always agree with him, but he is
    always worth listening to, and what he says is worthy of our
    serious consideration. We think he is <i>too</i> philosophical
    sometimes, but then the fault may be in us. It may be that we
    are so accustomed to the materialism of the English critics
    that we fail, at first, to apprehend the spirituality of this
    most refined and refining of Frenchmen. No English critic could
    have written his "Art in Greece," because no English critic
    could put himself in his place. We know what the English think
    of Greek Art, or may, with a little reading: what Taine thinks
    of it is&mdash;that it is what it is, simply because the Greeks
    were what they were. Before he tells us what Greek Art is, he
    tells us what the Greeks were. Nor does he stop here, but goes
    on to tell us, or rather begins by telling us, what kind of a
    country it was in which they dwelt, what skies shone over them,
    what mountains looked down upon them, in the shadow of what
    trees they walked within sight of the wine-dark sea. He begins
    at the beginning, as the children say. Whether he succeeds in
    convincing us that it was Greece alone which made the Greeks
    what they were, depends somewhat upon the cast of our minds,
    and somewhat upon our power to resist his eloquence. We think,
    ourselves, that he lays too much stress upon the mere outward
    environment of the Grecian people. The influence exercised over
    their lives, by the Institutions which grew up out of these
    lives&mdash;the influence, in short, of their purely physical
    culture&mdash;is admirably described, as is also the difference
    between this culture and ours:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Modern people are Christian, and Christianity is a
        religion of second growth which opposes natural instinct.
        We may liken it to a violent contraction which has
        inflected the primitive attitude of the human mind. It
        proclaims, in effect, that the world is sinful, and that
        man is depraved&mdash;which certainly is indisputable in
        the century in which it was born. According to it, man must
        change his ways. Life here below is simply an exile; let us
        turn our eyes upward to our celestial home. Our natural
        character is vicious; let us stifle natural desires and
        mortify the flesh. The experience of our senses and the
        knowledge of the wise are inadequate and delusive; let us
        accept the light of revelation, faith and divine
        illumination. Through penitence, renunciation and
        meditation let us develop within ourselves the spiritual
        man; let our life be an ardent awaiting of deliverance, a
        constant sacrifice of will, an undying yearning for God, a
        revery of sublime love, occasionally rewarded with ecstasy
        and a vision of the infinite. For fourteen centuries the
        ideal of this life was the anchorite or monk. If you would
        estimate the power of such a conception and the grandeur of
        the transformation it imposes on human faculties and
        habits, read, in turn, the great Christian poem and the
        great pagan poem, one the 'Divine Comedy' and the other the
        'Odyssey' and the 'Iliad.' Dante has a vision and is
        transported out of our little ephemeral sphere into eternal
        regions; he beholds its tortures, its expiations and its
        felicities; he is affected by superhuman anguish and
        horror; all that the infuriate and subtle imagination of
        the lover of justice and the executioner can conceive of he
        sees, suffers and sinks under. He then ascends into light;
        his body loses its gravity; he floats involuntarily, led by
        the smile of a radiant woman; he listens to souls in the
        shape of voices and to passing melodies; he sees choirs of
        angels, a vast rose of living brightness representing the
        virtues and the celestial powers; sacred utterances and the
        dogmas of truth reverberate in ethereal space. At this
        fervid height, where reason melts like wax, both symbol and
        apparition, one effacing the other, merge into mystic
        bewilderment, the entire poem, infernal or divine, being a
        dream which begins with horrors and ends in ravishment. How
        much more natural and healthy is the spectacle which Homer
        presents! We have the Troad, the isle of Ithica and the
        coasts of Greece; still at the present day we follow in his
        track; we recognize the forms of mountains, the color of
        the sea; the jutting fountains, the cypress and the alders
        in which the sea-birds perched; he copied a steadfast and
        persistent nature: with him throughout we plant our feet on
        the firm ground of truth. His book is a historical
        document; the manners and customs of his contemporaries
        were such as he describes; his Olympus itself is a Greek
        family."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The manifest inferiority of our mixed languages to their one
    simple language is stated in the following paragraph, with
    which we must leave Taine for the present:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Almost the whole of our philosophic and scientific
        vocabulary is foreign; we are obliged to know Greek and
        Latin to make use of it properly, and, most frequently,
        employ it badly. Innumerable terms find their way out of
        this technical vocabulary into common conversation and
        literary style, and hence it is that we now speak and think
        with words cumbersome and difficult to manage. We adopt
        them ready made and conjoined, we repeat them according to
        routine; we make use of them without considering their
        scope and without a nice appreciation of their sense; we
        only approximate to that which we would like to express.
        Fifteen years are necessary for an author to learn to
        write, not with genius, for that is not to be acquired, but
        with clearness, sequence, propriety and precision. He finds
        himself obliged to weigh and investigate ten or twelve
        thousand words and diverse expressions, to note their
        origin, filiation and relationships, to rebuild on an
        original plan, his ideas and his whole intellect. If he has
        not done it, and he wishes to reason on rights, duties, the
        beautiful, the State or any other of man's important
        interests, he gropes about and stumbles; he gets entangled
        in long, vague phrases, in sonorous common-places, in
        crabbed and abstract formulas. Look at the newspapers and
        the speeches of our popular orators. It is especially the
        case with workmen who are intelligent but who have had no
        classical education; they are not masters of words, and,
        consequently, of ideas; they use a refined language which
        is not natural to them; it is a perplexity to them and
        consequently confuses their minds; they have had no time to
        filter it drop by drop. This is an enormous disadvantage,
        from which the Greeks were exempt. There was no break with
        them between the language of concrete facts and that of
        abstract reasoning, between the language spoken by the
        people and that of the learned; the one was a counterpart
        of the other; there was no term in any of Plato's dialogues
        which a youth, leaving his gymnasia, could not comprehend;
        there is not a phrase in any of Demosthenes' harangues
        which did not readily find a lodging-place in the brain of
        an Athenian peasant or blacksmith. Attempt to translate
        into Greek one of Pitt's or Mirabeau's discourses, or an
        extract from Addison or Nicole, and you will be obliged to
        recast and transpose the thought; you will be led to find
        for the same thoughts, expressions more akin to facts and
        to concrete experience; a flood of light will heighten the
        prominence of all the truths and of all the errors; that
        which you were wont to call natural and clear will seem to
        you affected and semi-obscure, and you will perceive by
        force of contrast why, among the Greeks, the instrument of
        thought being more simple, it did its office better and
        with less effort."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Among the good books of the year, two belong to a special
    walk of letters in which we have not hitherto excelled the
    English Translation. There are periods in the history of
    English Poetry when translation has played an important part.
    Such a period occurred just before the Shakspearean era, and it
    was noted for translations from the Latin poets. Chapman was
    the first English writer to perceive the greatness of the Greek
    poets, and, like the poet that he was, he attempted to
    translate the father of poets, Homer. Chapman's Homer is a
    noble work, with all its faults; but it is not what Homer
    should be in English. It was followed by other translations
    mostly of the Latin poets, the best, perhaps, being Dryden's
    Virgil, until, finally, the English mind returned to Homer, or
    supposed it did, in the pretty, musical numbers of Pope. Who
    will may read Pope's Homer. We cannot. Nor Cowper's either,
    although it contains some good, manly writing. We can read Lord
    Derby's Homer, or could, until Mr. Bryant published his
    translation of the "Iliad," when the necessity no longer
    existed. No English translation of Homer will compare with Mr.
    Bryant's; and we are glad that we are soon to have the whole of
    the "Odyssey," as we already have the whole of the "Iliad." The
    first volume of Mr. Bryant's translation of the "Odyssey" (J.R.
    Osgood &amp; Co.) fully sustains the reputation of the writer.
    It is so admirably done, that, if we did not know to the
    contrary, we should think we were reading an original poem. The
    stiffness which generally inheres in translations is wanting;
    nowhere is there any sense of restraint, but everywhere a
    delightful sense of ease&mdash;the freedom of one great poet
    shining through the freedom of another great poet, as the sun
    shines through the sky. It is the ideal English translation of
    Homer; and we congratulate Mr. Bryant upon having finished it
    (for we believe he has); and congratulate ourselves that it is
    the work of an American poet.</p>

    <p>We offer the like congratulation to Mr. Bayard Taylor for
    his translation of "Faust," which occupies the same place, as
    regards German Poetry, that Mr. Bryant's translation of Homer
    does to Greek Poetry. The difficulty of the task which Mr.
    Taylor set himself, the task of rendering the original in the
    measures of the original, was never met before by any English
    translator of "Faust"&mdash;never even attempted, we
    believe&mdash;and, to say that he has accomplished it, is to
    say that Mr. Taylor is a very skilful poet&mdash;how skilful we
    never knew before, highly as we have always valued his poetical
    powers. He enables us to understand the <i>Intention</i> of
    Goethe in "Faust," as no one besides himself has done; and,
    among the obligations that we owe him for the enjoyment he has
    given us, we must not forget the obligation we are under to him
    for his <i>Notes</i>. They are scholarly, and to the point.
    There is not one too many, not one which we could afford to
    lose, now that we have it. What <i>might</i> have been written,
    under the pretense of <i>Notes</i>&mdash;what another
    translator might not have been able to resist writing&mdash;is
    fearful to think of&mdash;Life is so short, and Goethe's Art so
    long!</p>

    <p>The year has been fertile in American verse. How much Poetry
    it has produced is a question into which we do not care to
    enter. It has witnessed the publication of two volumes by Mr.
    Bret Harte; of one volume by Mr. John Hay; and of one volume by
    Mr. William Winter. The title of Mr. Winter's volume, "My
    Witness," (J.R. Osgood &amp; Co.) is a happy one. It is not
    every American writer who can afford to place his verse on the
    stand as his witness; and it is not every American writer whose
    verse will substantiate what he is so desirous of proving,
    viz., that he is an American poet.</p>

    <p>Mr. Winter is not without faults&mdash;what American writer
    is?&mdash;but he endeavors to write simply. The virtue of
    simplicity&mdash;always a rare one, and never so rare as at
    present&mdash;he possesses. We have Tennyson, who is not
    simple; we have Browning, who is not simple; we have Swinburne,
    who is not simple; and we have Mr. Joaquin Miller, who is not
    simple.</p>

    <p>Mr. Winter's book has its defects&mdash;among which we
    observe an occasional lapse into Latinity&mdash;but with all
    its defects it is a very <i>poetical</i> book. Mr. Winter
    reminds us, more than any recent American poet, of the English
    poets of the reigns of Charles the First and Second. He has, at
    his best, all their graces of style, and he has, at all times,
    the grace of Purity, to which they laid no claim. With the
    exception of Carew (whom, we dare say, he has never read), Mr.
    Winter is the daintiest and sweetest of amatory poets. He has
    the fancy of Carew, without his artificiality; he has Carew's
    sweetness, without his grossness of suggestion.</p>

    <p>There is a tinge of sadness in some of Mr. Winter's poems,
    and the critics, we suppose, will censure him for it. If so,
    they will be in the wrong. The poet has the right to express
    his moods, sad or merry, and he is no more to be judged by his
    sad moods than his merry ones. He is to be judged by both, and
    the sum of both&mdash;if the critic is able to add it
    up&mdash;is the poet. As far as he is revealed in his book,
    that is, but no further. There is such a thing as Dramatic
    Poetry, as some critics are aware, and there is such a thing as
    Representative Poetry, as few critics are aware. The former
    deals with the passions, the latter with those shadowy and
    evanescent sensations which we call feelings. Mr. Winter is not
    a dramatic poet, but he is, in his own way, a representative
    poet. His poem "Lethe" represents one set of feelings; "The
    White Flag" another; and "Love's Queen" another. We like the
    last best. For, while we believe the others to be equally
    genuine, they do not impress us as being the best expression of
    his genius. What we feel most after finishing his volume, what
    seems to us most characteristic of his poetry, is
    loveliness&mdash;the tender loveliness that lingers in the mind
    after we have seen the sun-set of a quiet summer evening, or
    after we have heard music on a dreamy summer night. If this
    poetic melancholy be treason, the critics may make the most of
    it. Mr. Winter has nothing to fear. He has the authority of the
    greatest poets with which to defend himself, and confute the
    critics.</p>

    <h2><a name="art"
       id="art"><i>ART.</i></a></h2>

    <h3>THE PRODIGAL SON, BY EDOUARD DUBUFE.</h3>

    <p>The sublime lesson of forgiveness, inculcated by the story
    of the Prodigal Son, is among the earliest and most familiar in
    the memories of a nation of Bible readers like our own. Every
    one of us, perhaps unconsciously, carries in mind a simple,
    straight-forward conception of this subject, formed in early
    childhood&mdash;a time when the imagination rarely goes beyond
    an attempt to realize the unlooked for forgiveness of the once
    deserted parent, or the captivating visions of adventure
    suggested by the changing fortunes of the wanderer during his
    absence in a "far country."</p>

    <p>With the painter the picture is his vision, and the panels
    are the realities. As a man of a different order of thought
    would have chosen another incident of the story for
    illustration, so also would a painter of a less independent
    school have permitted himself to be bound down by the
    historical facts of the architectural and costume fashions of
    the time of narration. Dubufe has so far discarded the unities
    of time and place, if any can <i>really</i> be said to
    exist&mdash;as no date was fixed in the relation of the parable
    by Christ&mdash;that he has adopted the mingled costumes of
    Europe and the East, which obtained in the fifteenth century,
    and has placed his figures in a Corinthian porch under the
    light of Italian skies. Apart from the conception and the
    "telling of the story," about which there will be various
    opinions, this picture may be justly regarded as a magnificent
    work of art.</p>

    <p>The great David, a pupil of whose pupil Edouard Dubufe was,
    and Horace Vernet, appear to have been the guides selected by
    him, rather than the greatest of his masters&mdash;Paul
    Delaroche. The influence of both is to be traced in this work,
    although it may be said to take rank above any production of
    either of them. In drawing, color, and composition, rendering
    of textures, and the exhibition of the resources of the
    palette, now better known to French painters than ever before,
    the picture leaves nothing to be desired. The faces of the
    principal figures are full of that "expression to the life" in
    which the English are justly considered to excel, while the
    admirable focus of the groups, the color, and interest, are as
    un-English as excellent. Fault-finding in more than one or two
    unimportant details would be hypercriticism where so much is
    perfect, and it becomes our happy privilege, in this notice, to
    commend and to point out, to "lay" readers about Art, the
    manifold beauties of its technical execution. A critical
    examination will show that the composition is on the pyramidal
    principle, and the arrangement of groups principally in threes.
    In the central portion of the canvas, where the marble pillars
    of the porch fall off in perspective, the Profligate stands
    holding up a golden cup in his right hand, as in the act of
    proposing a toast. His red costume and commanding figure
    attract the eye, and the attention falls at once and equally on
    him and on the magnificent woman whose arms embrace his neck,
    and whose eyes, as her chin rests close on his breast, gaze
    with dangerous fascination into his face. Her dress is of rich
    white satin, and, with the delicate green and gold sheen of her
    rival's robe&mdash;she with whom the Prodigal's right hand toys
    in caress&mdash;makes up a wonderfully brilliant prismatic
    chord, having the effect of focusing the richer, but not less
    gorgeous, pigments spread everywhere on the canvas. The faces
    of the women are very beautiful, and are made voluptuous by a
    subtle art which, through all their beauty, tells a story of
    unrestrained lives of passion and pleasure.</p>

    <p>The face of the magnificent creature at the Prodigal's left
    hand is a wondrous piece of drawing. It is thrown back against
    him and from the spectator, in order that she may look up into
    his face&mdash;at the moment a dissipated, spiritless face,
    without even the flush of the wine which dyes her's so
    rosily&mdash;a face at once weak and weary, and yet revealing a
    possible intensity, indeed, the face of a French woman who "has
    lived," rather than that of a man.</p>

    <p>Up to this centre leads the other groups. Below, and seated
    on the rich rugs which cover the marble pavement, musicians and
    singers pause to listen to impassioned words from a
    laurel-crowned poet, while further on a sort of orchestra plays
    time for the sensuous dance of lithe-bodied Oriental
    dancers&mdash;each woman of them more ravishing than the other.
    Minor incidents, like dice-play and love-making, give interest
    to the remaining space, and keep up the revel.</p>

    <p>Throughout, the drawing is true, and good, and graceful. The
    hands of the figures demand especial mention. The hand of one
    of the women, near the central group, grasped by her lover at
    the wrist as he kisses her shoulder, is particularly exquisite
    in form and color; the more remarkable, perhaps, because the
    position of it is so trying in nature and so difficult to
    draw.</p>

    <p>The type of feature chosen for the women, the dancing girls
    excepted, is essentially Gallic. As remarked before, the face
    of the Prodigal, also, is French; but the musicians and the
    poet have faces of their own which seem to belong to the
    university of genius. The mere revelers, curiously enough, have
    a likeness to the figures in some old Italian pictures; one of
    them looks like a copy of Judas Iscariot, made younger.</p>

    <p>A distant city and mountains fill up the background, and, on
    the extreme right of the near middle distance, flights of
    marble steps ascend to a grand doorway, where servants are seen
    loitering within easy call of their masters.</p>

    <p>It was by a sublime inspiration that Dubufe painted the
    accessory panels in monotone. In that on the right, a dismal
    sky, filled with rolling clouds and sad presaging ravens
    flying, over-shadows the outcast, seated on a rock in an
    attitude of listless dejection, with the swine feeding at his
    feet. In the panel on the left he is seen in the close embrace
    of his merciful parent. His head is bowed in humility, and, in
    an agony of remorse and shame, while the old house-dog sniffs
    at him for an obtrusive mendicant who has no business with such
    affectionate welcome.</p>

    <p>Let us congratulate ourselves that this picture has come to
    our country, as yet so barren of great works, and pray that the
    noble school of art of which this is so admirable an exponent,
    may find favor, not only with our painters, but with those who
    call themselves connoisseurs, in preference to unmeaning works
    of microscopic finish, or slick examples of boudoir and
    millinery painting.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
